# 2.1 — Why APIs (Instructor Script)

**Length:** 5–6 min

Hook: “Your Sheet prototype is useful. An API makes it usable *everywhere*.”

Key points
- APIs let other apps call your logic consistently.
- HTTP concepts you’ll actually use: GET/POST, 2xx/4xx/5xx, idempotency, rate limits.
- Small surface area beats “big framework everything.”
