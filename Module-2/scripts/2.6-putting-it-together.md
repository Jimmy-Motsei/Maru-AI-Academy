# 2.6 — Putting it together (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~10 min

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Let's chain it all together. The real power comes when you use the same inputs to create multiple outputs.

**One source, four outputs** — all consistent, all professional, all ready to use.

This is how you turn 4 hours of work into 30 minutes."

## The workflow (4 minutes)
"Here's the **complete workflow**:

**Step 1**: Use the **Base Work Prompt** to create an email reply.

**Step 2**: Ask for a **slide outline** of the same content.

**Step 3**: Ask for a **decision summary** with next steps.

**Step 4**: Extract a **task table** for tracking and a **weekly reminder** message.

_[Show the workflow on screen]_

**Example scenario**: Client project update
- **Input**: Project status meeting notes
- **Output 1**: Professional email to client
- **Output 2**: 6-slide internal presentation
- **Output 3**: Executive summary with risks and opportunities
- **Output 4**: Task tracking table and team reminder"

## Live demonstration (3 minutes)
"Let me show you this in action:

_[Use the same input to generate all four outputs]_

**Email**: 'Dear Sarah, Here's our Q4 project update...'
**Slides**: 'Slide 1: Project Overview, Slide 2: Key Achievements...'
**Summary**: 'Key takeaways: 3 major milestones completed, 1 risk identified...'
**Tracking**: 'Task | Owner | Due | Status | Notes...'

All from the same source material, all consistent, all professional."

## Template organization (2 minutes)
"Save these as **templates** in your prompts folder so next time it's drag-and-drop:

**'Workflow - Client Update'**
- Email template
- Presentation template  
- Summary template
- Tracking template

**'Workflow - Internal Meeting'**
- Meeting notes template
- Action items template
- Follow-up template

**'Workflow - Project Status'**
- Status report template
- Risk assessment template
- Next steps template

The more workflows you create, the faster you get."

## Quality control (2 minutes)
"**Always do a final human check** before sending:

- **Email**: Check tone, verify facts, ensure clarity
- **Slides**: Review flow, test timing, confirm examples
- **Summary**: Validate insights, check recommendations
- **Tracking**: Verify assignments, confirm deadlines

**You remain accountable** for all outputs. AI accelerates you; you ensure quality.

**Pro tip**: Create a 5-minute checklist for each output type. This catches 90% of issues before they become problems."

## The compound effect (1 minute)
"**Time saved per workflow**: 3-4 hours
**Workflows per week**: 5-10
**Total time saved**: 15-40 hours per week

**Quality improvement**: More consistent, professional, and complete work.

**Stress reduction**: Less last-minute scrambling, better preparation.

**Career impact**: You become known as the person who gets things done efficiently and professionally.

This is how you become a super-productive professional who uses AI as their secret weapon."
