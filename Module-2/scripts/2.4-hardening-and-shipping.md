# 2.4 â€” Reports & summaries (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Reports turn faster when you ask for **decisions**, not just summaries.

Most people spend hours reading long documents and still miss the key points. Here's how to extract actionable insights in minutes."

## The report template (4 minutes)
"Here's your **report template**:

**Role:** Act as an analyst for {team}.

**Goal:** Produce a brief summary with risks, opportunities, and recommended next steps.

**Inputs:** {paste text} or {link + pasted key excerpts}.

**Rules:** POPIA: no personal data. Quote exact figures with source lines. No invented facts.

**Format:** 5 bullets: **Key takeaways (x3), Risks (x1), Next steps (x1)**; then a one-paragraph narrative.

This works for contracts, research papers, meeting notes, financial reports, and any lengthy document."

## Example in action (3 minutes)
"**Example ask:**
'Analyze this quarterly sales report and provide key insights for the management team. Focus on trends, risks, and recommended actions.'

## Upgrade: Quality checks (2 minutes)
"Ask: '**Call out any assumptions and data gaps.**'

This helps you:
- Understand what the AI is assuming
- Identify missing information
- Make informed decisions about next steps
- Avoid acting on incomplete data

**Example output:**
'Assumptions: Assuming Q4 trends continue, assuming current market conditions persist. Data gaps: Missing competitor analysis, no customer satisfaction data for Q4.'"

## Export options (2 minutes)
"Request **CSV or markdown table** if you want to track items later.

**CSV format for tracking:**
