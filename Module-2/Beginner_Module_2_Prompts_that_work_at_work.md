## Section 1: The reusable prompt frame (make once, use daily)

### Instructor Script
Welcome to Module 2. Our goal is to turn good prompts into **reusable templates** you can use every day.  
Recall the 5-part prompt: **Role → Goal → Inputs → Rules → Format**.

Today we’ll add two upgrades:
1) **Variables** — placeholders you swap quickly, like `{client_name}`, `{deadline}`, `{tone}`.  
2) **Quality checks** — ask the AI to **list assumptions** and **flag missing info** before finishing.

**Template you can save:**
- **Role:** Act as a helpful {role} for a {industry} business.  
- **Goal:** Produce {deliverable} that achieves {outcome}.  
- **Inputs:** {paste raw text, bullets, or transcript}.  
- **Rules:** Be {tone}. Keep facts grounded in inputs. If info is missing, ask 2–3 clarifying questions. Apply POPIA (no personal data).  
- **Format:** Return {structure}, plus a short checklist at the end.

Store this as **“Work Prompt – Base”** and copy it whenever you start a task. Templates = **speed + consistency**.

### Quiz (3 questions)
1) The main benefit of adding `{variables}` to prompts is:  
   **B. You can reuse the same template quickly.**  
   *Rationale:* Variables support fast reuse.

2) Asking the AI to list assumptions helps to:  
   **B. Catch gaps before you send work.**  
   *Rationale:* Quality control.

3) The “Format” line should:  
   **B. Define the exact structure you want back.**  
   *Rationale:* Output shape drives usable results.

## Section 2: Email & customer replies (inbox to professional in 60 seconds)

### Instructor Script
Email is the fastest time-saver. Here’s a **reply template**:

- **Role:** Act as a polite customer support agent for {company}.  
- **Goal:** Draft a reply that answers {customer_topic} and confirms next steps.  
- **Inputs:** {paste thread or summary}. Include key facts: names, dates, references.  
- **Rules:** Be concise and friendly. No invented facts. If details are missing, ask up to 3 questions.  
- **Format:** Subject, greeting, 2–3 short paragraphs, bullets for actions, sign-off.

**Example ask:**  
“Turn this messy thread into a clear reply confirming the booking. If any detail is missing, ask questions at the end. Provide a short subject line.”

**Quality tip:** After you get the draft, say:  
“**Now check for tone, clarity, and missing info. Tighten it to 150–180 words.**”  
You keep control; AI accelerates your wording.

### Quiz (3 questions)
1) The best place to demand “no invented facts” is:  
   **C. Rules.**  
   *Rationale:* Behavioral constraints belong in Rules.

2) Good email format usually includes:  
   **A. Subject, greeting, body, actions, sign-off.**  
   *Rationale:* Clear structure = professional.

3) If details are missing, your prompt should:  
   **B. Ask the AI to list questions at the end.**  
   *Rationale:* Fill gaps safely.

## Section 3: Presentations & slide outlines (bullet points → deck skeleton)

### Instructor Script
Slides are about **structure**. Feed bullet points; ask for a deck outline with speaker notes.

**Template:**
- **Role:** Act as a presentation coach.  
- **Goal:** Turn {topic bullets} into a {#}-slide outline that informs {audience}.  
- **Inputs:** {paste bullets}.  
- **Rules:** Clear headlines, 3–5 bullets per slide, plain English. Add 1 insight or example per slide.  
- **Format:** Slide 1–{#}: Title; 3–5 bullets; speaker notes beneath.

**Example ask:**  
“Create a 6-slide outline on ‘AI to save 3–5 hours/day for a small business.’ Add notes with examples suitable for low-bandwidth teams.”

**Export tip:** Ask for a **table** with columns: Slide, Title, Bullets, Notes — easy to copy into your slide tool.

### Quiz (3 questions)
1) A strong slide outline includes:  
   **B. Short headline + 3–5 bullets + notes.**  
   *Rationale:* Slides need clarity and brevity.

2) For easy copy into tools, request output as a:  
   **B. Table.**  
   *Rationale:* Tabular output pastes well.

3) Speaker notes are useful because they:  
   **B. Guide the presenter with examples.**  
   *Rationale:* Notes enhance delivery.

## Section 4: Reports & summaries (long docs → decisions)

### Instructor Script
Reports turn faster when you ask for **decisions**, not just summaries.

**Template:**
- **Role:** Act as an analyst for {team}.  
- **Goal:** Produce a brief summary with risks, opportunities, and recommended next steps.  
- **Inputs:** {paste text} or {link + pasted key excerpts}.  
- **Rules:** POPIA: no personal data. Quote exact figures with source lines. No invented facts.  
- **Format:** 5 bullets: **Key takeaways (x3), Risks (x1), Next steps (x1)**; then a one-paragraph narrative.

**Upgrade:** Ask: “**Call out any assumptions and data gaps.**”  
**Export:** Request **CSV or markdown table** if you want to track items later.

### Quiz (3 questions)
1) Better than a generic summary is asking for:  
   **B. Risks, opportunities, and next steps.**  
   *Rationale:* Decision-ready output.

2) When quoting figures, the safest rule is to:  
   **B. Cite the source line.**  
   *Rationale:* Grounded facts.

3) To spot missing data, ask the AI to:  
   **B. List assumptions and gaps.**  
   *Rationale:* Quality control.

## Section 5: Tracking & follow-through (checklists, actions, progress)

### Instructor Script
Great work needs **follow-through**. Turn outputs into trackable items.

**Template:**
- **Role:** Act as an operations assistant.  
- **Goal:** Extract actions and create a weekly checklist.  
- **Inputs:** {paste email/report/notes}.  
- **Rules:** Group by owner; include due dates; mark blockers; keep to one screen.  
- **Format:** Table: **Task | Owner | Due | Status | Notes**. At the end, generate a **weekly reminder message** I can paste into email/WhatsApp.

**No-code tip:** Feed this table to your simple workflow tool or spreadsheet. You’ll have visibility and momentum without new software.

### Quiz (3 questions)
1) Best format for tracking actions is typically a:  
   **B. Table with Task/Owner/Due/Status.**  
   *Rationale:* Tables track progress.

2) Adding owners and due dates helps teams to:  
   **B. Know who does what by when.**  
   *Rationale:* Accountability.

3) A helpful closing output for nudges is a:  
   **B. Short reminder message.**  
   *Rationale:* Makes follow-through easy.

## Section 6: Putting it together (one prompt, many outputs)

### Instructor Script
Let’s chain it:  
1) Use the **Base Work Prompt** to create an email reply.  
2) Ask for a **slide outline** of the same content.  
3) Ask for a **decision summary** with next steps.  
4) Extract a **task table** for tracking and a **weekly reminder** message.

One source, four outputs — all consistent. Save these as **templates** in your prompts folder so next time it’s drag-and-drop.

### Quiz (3 questions)
1) Reusing the same inputs to produce email, slides, summary, and tasks gives you:  
   **B. Consistency and speed.**  
   *Rationale:* Single source of truth.

2) The best way to keep these steps repeatable is to:  
   **B. Save templates in a prompts folder.**  
   *Rationale:* Templates = repeatability.

3) Good practice after generating outputs is to:  
   **B. Do a final human check.**  
   *Rationale:* You remain accountable.

## Mini-Assignment (Beginner, Module 2)

**Task (15–30 min):**  
Choose a real work item (client enquiry, internal update, or short report). Using the templates from Sections 2–5, produce **all four outputs**:

1) A client-ready email reply (≤180 words)  
2) A 5–6 slide outline with notes  
3) A decision summary (5 bullets + 1 paragraph)  
4) A task table (**Task | Owner | Due | Status | Notes**) + a 2–3 sentence weekly reminder

**Submit:** Original text (anonymized), the four outputs, and a note of **minutes saved**.

**AI Rubric focus (what the scorer looks for):**  
- **Clarity & tone (40%)** — is the email and summary clear, polite, and actionable?  
- **Structure & completeness (30%)** — did you follow the requested formats?  
- **Safety & grounding (30%)** — no invented facts, no personal data, sources cited where needed.
