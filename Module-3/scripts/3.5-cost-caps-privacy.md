# 3.5 â€” Cost caps & privacy guardrails (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Protect your wallet and your customers with two quick setups.

Most people either ignore costs until they get a surprise bill, or they're so worried about privacy they never use AI at all.

Today we'll set up simple, non-negotiable rules that keep you safe and profitable."

## Cost caps (4 minutes)
"**Use a tool that supports monthly limits and alerts**

**Set monthly spending limits**:
- Start with $50/month
- Increase only if you're saving more time than the cost
- Set alerts at 75% and 90% of your limit

**Prefer cheaper models for drafts**:
- Use GPT-3.5 for first drafts (cheaper)
- Use GPT-4 only for final checks (more expensive but better quality)
- Reserve premium models for important customer communications

**Cache and reuse prompts/templates**:
- Save successful prompts to avoid rewriting
- Use templates to reduce prompt length
- Batch similar requests together

**Example cost control**:
- Draft replies: GPT-3.5 ($0.002 per 1K tokens)
- Final review: GPT-4 ($0.03 per 1K tokens)
- Monthly limit: $50
- Alert at: $37.50 (75%) and $45 (90%)"

## Privacy rules (4 minutes)
"**Treat personal data as red unless you have consent**

**Data classification**:
- **Red data**: Never share (ID numbers, financial info, health records)
- **Yellow data**: Be careful (names, contact details, internal communications)
- **Green data**: Safe to share (public information, anonymized examples)

**Share the least data needed**:
- Remove names and IDs when possible
- Use 'Customer A' instead of 'John Smith'
- Anonymize company names: 'Tech Company' instead of 'ABC Corp'
- Extract only relevant information

**Keep a one-page policy**:
- What data is allowed in AI tools
- Who can approve data sharing
- How long you retain logs
- What to do if there's a data breach

**Example policy**:
- Only green data goes to AI tools
- Yellow data requires manager approval
- Red data never leaves our systems
- All AI interactions are logged
- Logs kept for 90 days then deleted"

## The wall checklist (2 minutes)
"**Post this checklist on your wall**:

'**No invented facts. Ask when unsure. Cite sources where relevant. Human review before sending.**'

**What this means**:
- **No invented facts**: AI can't make up information
- **Ask when unsure**: If AI doesn't know, it should say so
- **Cite sources**: When possible, include where information came from
- **Human review**: Always check AI output before sending to customers

**Make it visible**: Print this and put it where everyone can see it

**Train your team**: Make sure everyone understands these rules

**Update regularly**: Review and update the policy monthly"

## Emergency procedures (2 minutes)
"**If you get a surprise bill**:
- Check what caused the spike
- Adjust limits immediately
- Review usage patterns
- Consider switching to cheaper models

**If there's a data breach**:
- Stop using the tool immediately
- Notify your manager
- Check what data was exposed
- Follow your company's breach procedures

**If quality drops**:
- Review your prompts
- Check if you're using the right model
- Test with simpler examples
- Get human feedback on outputs

**If team stops using it**:
- Check if it's too complex
- Look for technical issues
- Ask for feedback
- Simplify the process"

## Regular reviews (1 minute)
"**Weekly**: Check costs and usage
**Monthly**: Review privacy policy and update if needed
**Quarterly**: Assess overall value and plan improvements

**Key questions**:
- Are we saving more time than we're spending?
- Are we following privacy rules?
- Is the team using the tools effectively?
- What can we improve?

**Remember**: It's better to be safe and slow than fast and risky."
