# 3.2 — No-code automation basics (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"No-code automations are **recipes**. Think: **Trigger → Actions → Checks**.

Most people think automation is complicated, but it's just following a recipe. When X happens, do Y, but only if Z is true.

Today we'll learn the simple pattern that works for 90% of business automations."

## The three-part pattern (4 minutes)

"**Trigger:** the event that starts the flow.

Examples:

- 'New enquiry email arrives'
- 'Form submitted on website'
- 'File uploaded to Google Drive'
- 'Calendar event created'
- 'Payment received'

**Actions:** steps that happen next.

Examples:

- 'Draft reply → send for approval → log to sheet/CRM'
- 'Extract data → send to team → create task'
- 'Generate report → email to manager → save to folder'
- 'Create calendar invite → send confirmation → update CRM'

**Checks (guardrails):** rules that prevent mistakes.

Examples:

- 'If message lacks phone number, ask for it instead of sending'
- 'If amount is over $1000, require manager approval'
- 'If email is from competitor, flag for review'
- 'If file is over 10MB, compress before processing'"

## Golden rules (3 minutes)

"**Rule 1: Keep the first version short** (2–3 actions)

Don't try to automate everything at once. Start with:

- Trigger: New enquiry arrives
- Action 1: Draft reply
- Action 2: Send for approval
- Action 3: Log to sheet

That's it. You can add more later.

**Rule 2: Always include a human-approval step** for anything customer-facing

Never let AI send emails directly to customers. Always:

- Draft the reply
- Send to human for review
- Human sends after approval

**Rule 3: Log every run** (timestamp, contact, outcome)

Track:

- When it ran
- What it processed
- What it did
- Whether it succeeded or failed

This helps you audit and improve."

## Common automation patterns (2 minutes)

"**Customer Service Pattern**:

- Trigger: New support ticket
- Actions: Categorize → assign → send acknowledgment
- Checks: If urgent, notify manager

**Lead Management Pattern**:

- Trigger: New form submission
- Actions: Score lead → add to CRM → send follow-up
- Checks: If high-value, notify sales team

**Content Creation Pattern**:

- Trigger: New blog post idea
- Actions: Research → outline → draft
- Checks: If controversial, flag for review

**Reporting Pattern**:

- Trigger: End of week
- Actions: Collect data → generate report → email team
- Checks: If numbers are unusual, highlight for review"

## Getting started (1 minute)

"**Step 1**: Pick one process you do daily
**Step 2**: Identify the trigger (what starts it?)
**Step 3**: List 2-3 actions you want to automate
**Step 4**: Add one check to prevent mistakes
**Step 5**: Test with a few examples before going live

**Pro tip**: Start with processes that take 15+ minutes and happen 3+ times per week.

**Tools to consider**: Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, IFTTT, or even simple email rules."
