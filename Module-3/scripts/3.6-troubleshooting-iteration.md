# 3.6 â€” Troubleshooting & iteration (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~10 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Every flow needs **tuning**. Use this checklist to make it better each week.

Most people build an automation, set it running, and forget about it. But the best automations get better over time through regular review and improvement.

Today we'll learn how to troubleshoot common issues and iterate your way to success."

## Common problems and solutions (4 minutes)

"**If outputs are vague**: tighten the **Goal** and **Format**; add examples

**Problem**: AI gives generic responses
**Solution**:

- Make your goal more specific: 'Draft a polite reply asking for budget and timeline' instead of 'Draft a reply'
- Add format requirements: 'Include subject line, greeting, 2 paragraphs, 3 bullet points, sign-off'
- Provide examples of good outputs

**If info is missing**: prompt the AI to **list assumptions** and questions

**Problem**: AI makes assumptions instead of asking
**Solution**:

- Add to your rules: 'List your assumptions and ask clarifying questions if information is missing'
- Review the assumptions before sending
- Update your prompts based on common missing information

**If tone is off**: add **tone words** (warm, direct, formal) and word limits

**Problem**: AI sounds too robotic or too casual
**Solution**:

- Add tone guidance: 'Be warm and professional, like talking to a friend who's also a client'
- Set word limits: 'Keep responses between 120-160 words'
- Test with different tone words until you find what works

**If errors slip through**: add a **human-approval** step earlier

**Problem**: Mistakes reach customers
**Solution**:

- Add more approval steps
- Create checklists for reviewers
- Flag high-risk content for extra review
- Train your team on what to look for

**If costs rise**: switch to a **cheaper model** for drafts; limit run frequency

**Problem**: Monthly bills are too high
**Solution**:

- Use GPT-3.5 for drafts, GPT-4 only for final review
- Reduce automation frequency
- Batch similar requests together
- Set stricter usage limits"

## The Friday 15-minute review (2 minutes)

"**Run a Friday 15-minute review**: look at the log, update prompts, and celebrate time saved.

**Step 1 (5 minutes)**: Review the week's log

- How many enquiries processed?
- How much time saved?
- Any errors or issues?
- What worked well?

**Step 2 (5 minutes)**: Update prompts based on what you learned

- Tighten vague goals
- Add missing tone guidance
- Include new examples
- Fix common problems

**Step 3 (5 minutes)**: Celebrate wins and plan improvements

- Share time-saved numbers with your team
- Identify next process to automate
- Set goals for next week
- Update your tracking dashboard

**Make it a habit**: Put it in your calendar every Friday at 4 PM"

## Iteration cycle (2 minutes)

"**Week 1**: Build the basic flow
**Week 2**: Fix obvious problems
**Week 3**: Optimize for speed and quality
**Week 4**: Add new features or processes

**Monthly review**:

- Calculate total time and money saved
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Plan next automation project
- Share success stories with management

**Quarterly assessment**:

- Evaluate overall ROI
- Update privacy and cost policies
- Train team on new features
- Plan major improvements or expansions"

## Pro tips (1 minute)

"**Start small, improve fast**: Better to have a simple automation that works than a complex one that breaks

**Measure everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure

**Get feedback**: Ask your team and customers what's working and what isn't

**Celebrate wins**: Share success stories to build momentum

**Stay curious**: Always look for new ways to save time and improve quality

**Remember**: The goal isn't perfect automation, it's continuous improvement"

## Your action plan (1 minute)

"**This week**: Build your first automation
**Next week**: Run the Friday review and fix issues
**Week 3**: Optimize and add features
**Week 4**: Plan your next automation

**Long-term**: Aim to save 2+ hours per day through multiple automations

**Success metric**: Time saved > Time spent on automation + Costs

You now have everything you need to build, track, and improve your AI automations. Start small, measure everything, and iterate your way to success!"
