# 3.1 — Choose the right tool (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Welcome to Module 3. Today we'll choose tools the **easy way** and build your **first no-code automation**.

Most people get overwhelmed by all the AI tools available. They try everything and end up using nothing effectively. Today we'll use a simple checklist to pick the right tools for your specific needs."

## The 5-point checklist (6 minutes)

"Use this **5-point checklist** when picking a tool:

**1. Job to be done** — What exact task will it do?

- Be specific: 'auto-reply to enquiries' not 'help with communication'
- Example: 'Summarize PDFs under 10 pages in under 2 minutes'
- Example: 'Draft polite email replies for customer service'

**2. Data safety** — POPIA: does it store personal data? Can you anonymize? Is there a privacy policy and data export?

- Check the privacy policy before signing up
- Look for data export options
- Can you anonymize sensitive information?
- Does it comply with your company's data policies?

**3. Bandwidth & devices** — Works well on mobile? Low-data mode or transcript-first?

- Will your team use it on phones?
- Does it work with slow internet?
- Can you get transcripts instead of video calls?

**4. Cost & limits** — Free tier, monthly cap, per-use fees. Can you set **usage caps** and alerts?

- What's the free tier limit?
- How much does it cost per use?
- Can you set monthly spending limits?
- Will you get alerts before hitting limits?

**5. Fit & support** — Is it simple enough for your team? Tutorials? Local support or community?

- Can your least tech-savvy team member use it?
- Are there good tutorials and documentation?
- Is there local support or an active community?
- Does it integrate with tools you already use?"

## Rule of thumb (2 minutes)

"**Start small**: Begin with **one chat assistant** + **one document helper** + **one no-code automation tool**.

**Prove value in a week**: Pick one tool, use it for 7 days, measure the time saved. If it works, add another.

**Don't try to automate everything at once**: Focus on one process that takes 30+ minutes per day.

**Examples of good starting combinations**:

- ChatGPT + Notion AI + Zapier
- Claude + PDF.ai + Microsoft Power Automate
- Google Bard + Perplexity + IFTTT

The key is to master one tool before adding the next."

## Common mistakes to avoid (2 minutes)

"**Mistake 1**: Choosing tools based on features, not needs

- **Solution**: Start with the job to be done, then find the tool

**Mistake 2**: Not checking data safety and privacy

- **Solution**: Always read privacy policies and check data export options

**Mistake 3**: Ignoring cost limits and getting surprise bills

- **Solution**: Set usage caps and alerts from day one

**Mistake 4**: Choosing complex tools that your team can't use

- **Solution**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed

**Mistake 5**: Trying to automate everything at once

- **Solution**: Pick one process, prove value, then expand"

## Your action plan (1 minute)

"**This week**: Pick one tool from each category using the checklist
**Next week**: Use them daily and measure time saved
**Week 3**: Add one more tool if the first ones are working
**Week 4**: Build your first automation

Remember: It's better to use 3 tools really well than 10 tools poorly."
