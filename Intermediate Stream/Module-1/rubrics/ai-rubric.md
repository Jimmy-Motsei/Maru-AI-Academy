# AI Rubric â€” Intermediate Module 1

## Assessment Criteria

### Structure & Contracts (40%)

- **Variables clearly defined** (10%): All placeholders identified and documented
- **Constraints properly set** (10%): Word limits, tone, safety rules included
- **Output schema specified** (10%): Clear format requirements (JSON, table, etc.)
- **Validation rules included** (10%): Error handling and quality checks defined

### Grounding & Safety (30%)

- **Facts trace to inputs** (15%): All claims supported by provided data
- **POPIA compliance** (10%): No personal data beyond what's necessary
- **No invented information** (5%): AI doesn't create unsupported facts

### Reusability (30%)

- **Component clarity** (15%): Purpose, inputs, rules clearly documented
- **Version labeling** (10%): Proper versioning and change tracking
- **Cross-context applicability** (5%): Works with different inputs and scenarios

## Scoring Scale

- **Excellent (90-100%)**: Exceeds expectations, ready for production use
- **Good (80-89%)**: Meets expectations with minor improvements needed
- **Satisfactory (70-79%)**: Meets basic requirements, needs refinement
- **Needs Improvement (60-69%)**: Below expectations, significant work needed
- **Inadequate (<60%)**: Does not meet requirements, major revision needed

## Feedback Framework

1. **Strengths**: What worked well
2. **Improvements**: Specific areas for enhancement
3. **Next Steps**: Concrete actions to take
4. **Resources**: Links to relevant sections for improvement

## Common Issues

- Missing variable definitions
- Unclear output schemas
- Insufficient safety constraints
- Poor versioning practices
- Lack of validation rules
