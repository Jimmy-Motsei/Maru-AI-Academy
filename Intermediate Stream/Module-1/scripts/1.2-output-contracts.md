# 1.2 Output contracts (how to make AI predictable)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Think of the output as a **contract**. If the model agrees to the contract, you can depend on it in a workflow.

### Contract Checklist

**Schema:** exact keys/sections (e.g., `title`, `summary`, `risks`).  
**Types:** strings vs lists; allowed values (e.g., `priority` in {"low","med","high"}).  
**Limits:** word/character counts; bullet counts.  
**Validation sentence:** "If you cannot meet the schema, reply with `{"error":"missing_inputs"}` and list needed info."

### Tighten with Examples

Show **one good example** and **one bad anti-example** so the model learns what not to do.

**Tip:** After generating, ask the model to **self-check**: "Validate your output against the schema. If invalid, fix it."

## Example Contract

```json
{
  "title": "string (max 50 chars)",
  "summary": "string (max 200 words)",
  "risks": ["string array (max 5 items)"],
  "next_steps": ["string array (max 3 items)"],
  "assumptions": ["string array"],
  "questions": ["string array (max 3 items)"]
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- Output contracts define predictable, reliable responses
- Include validation rules and error handling
- Use examples to teach the model correct behavior
- Self-checking improves output quality
