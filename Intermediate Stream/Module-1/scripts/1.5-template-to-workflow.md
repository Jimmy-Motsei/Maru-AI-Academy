# 1.5 From template to workflow (email → brief → tasks)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Let's chain components into a reliable **mini-workflow**:

**Goal:** Turn an email thread into (1) a client-ready reply, (2) a decision brief (JSON), and (3) a task table.

### Step A: Email Reply (component)

- Role: support agent
- Rules: polite, 150–180 words; **no invented facts**; ask 2–3 questions if needed
- Format: email blocks

### Step B: Decision Brief (component)

- Role: analyst
- Format: JSON (`title`, `summary`, `risks`, `next_steps`, `assumptions`, `questions`)
- Constraints: max 180 words; cite figures to line numbers if provided

### Step C: Task Extract (component)

- Role: operations assistant
- Format: Table `Task | Owner | Due | Status | Notes`
- Rules: group by owner, set weekly due dates, mark blockers

### Hand-off Tip

Save the JSON/text to a sheet or database; it becomes searchable and trackable.

## Workflow Benefits

- Consistent outputs across all steps
- Machine-readable data for further processing
- Clear task tracking and accountability
- Reusable process for similar inputs

## Key Takeaways

- Chain components for multi-step workflows
- Use JSON for machine-readable outputs
- Include task tracking for execution
- Save outputs for searchability and tracking
