# 3.1 Automation patterns (triage, routing, approvals, logging)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Great automations follow repeatable **patterns**. Learn these four and you can build most business flows:

### 1) Triage — classify the incoming item
Determine lead type, urgency, topic, or category. This drives all downstream decisions.

### 2) Routing — send it to the right person/team
Based on triage results, route to sales, support, finance, or other appropriate teams.

### 3) Approval — a human checks any customer-facing draft
Never send customer communications without human review. This ensures quality and accountability.

### 4) Logging — write a record for audit and reporting
Track who, what, when, and result for compliance, analysis, and continuous improvement.

## Recipe Mindset
**Trigger → Triage → Draft → Approval → Action → Log → Notify**

Start small, then add branches (if/else) based on triage labels.

## Example Flow
```
Web form submission
↓
Triage: Classify as "demo request" + "high urgency" + "enterprise fit"
↓
Route: Send to enterprise sales team
↓
Draft: Generate personalized demo invitation
↓
Approval: Sales rep reviews and edits
↓
Action: Send approved email + calendar invite
↓
Log: Record in CRM with outcome
↓
Notify: Alert sales manager of new lead
```

## Key Takeaways
- Always include human approval for customer-facing content
- Logging creates audit trails and enables reporting
- Routing ensures work goes to the right place
- Start simple, then add complexity based on needs
