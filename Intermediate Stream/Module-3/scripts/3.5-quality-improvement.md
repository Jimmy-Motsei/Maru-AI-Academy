# 3.5 Quality checks, A/B tests, and continuous improvement

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Keep improving with light **experiments** and systematic quality checks.

### Quality Control Methods

**Self-check:**
- Ask the model to validate its own output
- Check schema compliance
- List assumptions and uncertainties
- Flag potential issues

**A/B Testing:**
- Compare two prompt versions on the same task
- Use small samples (20-50 cases)
- Pick the winner based on success rate
- Roll out improvements gradually

**Golden Set:**
- Maintain 10-20 representative test cases
- Re-run monthly to ensure quality stability
- Catch regressions before they impact users
- Update test cases as business evolves

**Feedback Capture:**
- Add thumbs-up/down from approvers
- Collect specific tags (tone/clarity/fact)
- Track improvement areas
- Close the feedback loop

### Iteration Cadence
- **Weekly**: 15-minute review of metrics and issues
- **Monthly**: Update prompts/components (versioned)
- **Quarterly**: Major automation redesign if needed

## Example A/B Test
```
Version A: "Draft a professional reply to this lead inquiry"
Version B: "Draft a warm, personalized reply that addresses their specific pain points"

Test: 50 leads each
Metric: Approval rate and customer satisfaction
Result: Version B wins with 15% higher approval rate
```

## Key Takeaways
- Implement systematic quality checks
- Use A/B testing to improve prompts
- Maintain golden sets for regression testing
- Capture and act on feedback regularly
- Establish regular improvement cadence
