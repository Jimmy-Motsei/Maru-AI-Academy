# 3.4 Monitoring, alerts, and dashboards

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Automations are "set-and-tend," not "set-and-forget." Track **health** and **impact**.

### Operational Metrics
Monitor these to keep automations healthy:
- **Success rate**: % of runs that complete successfully
- **Failure rate**: % of runs that fail or error out
- **Approval turnaround**: Time from draft to approval
- **Latency**: End-to-end processing time

### Business Metrics
Track these to prove value:
- **Volume processed**: Number of leads/items handled
- **Conversion rate**: % of leads that convert
- **Minutes saved**: Time ROI calculation
- **Revenue tied to automation**: Direct business impact

### Alert Triggers
Set up alerts for:
- Payment/webhook failures
- High failure rates (>10%)
- Approval queue backlog (>2 hours)
- Spend approaching monthly cap (80%)
- Unusual volume spikes

### Dashboard Strategy
**Start simple:**
- Use your Sheet/DB with basic charts
- Track key metrics daily
- Weekly trend analysis

**Scale up:**
- Move to BI tools (Data Studio/Power BI)
- Real-time monitoring
- Advanced analytics

## Example Dashboard
```
Daily Summary:
- Leads processed: 45
