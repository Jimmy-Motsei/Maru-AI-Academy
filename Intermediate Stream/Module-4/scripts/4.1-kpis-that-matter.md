# 4.1 KPIs that matter (from activity to outcomes)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Dashboards only help if they drive **decisions**. Shift from counting clicks to measuring **outcomes**.

### Outcome KPIs

**Time ROI:** minutes saved per run × volume (daily/weekly)

- This is your primary value metric
- Calculate: (manual time - automated time) × number of runs
- Track trends over time

**Quality:** rework rate and error rate

- Rework rate: how often humans must fix AI outputs
- Error rate: mistakes in customer-facing items
- Target: <10% rework rate

**Throughput:** items handled per day/week

- Response times for customer inquiries
- Processing volume trends
- Capacity utilization

**Conversion/Revenue (if applicable):** replies → meetings → sales

- Track the full funnel impact
- Measure downstream business value
- ROI beyond just time savings

**Adoption:** % of target users who used the workflow this week

- Are people actually using it?
- Identify training needs
- Measure team engagement

### Setting Targets

1. **Establish baseline** (last 2–4 weeks of manual work)
2. **Aim for +30–50% throughput** or **–40–60% time per item** in first month
3. **Track weekly** and adjust targets based on performance

## Example KPI Dashboard

```
This Week vs Last Week:
- Minutes saved: 240 (+15%)
- Items processed: 45 (+20%)
- Rework rate: 8% (-2%)
- User adoption: 85% (+10%)
- Cost per item: $2.50 (-15%)
```

## Key Takeaways

- Focus on outcome metrics, not activity metrics
- Time ROI is the primary value driver
- Set data-driven targets based on baselines
- Track trends, not just absolute numbers
