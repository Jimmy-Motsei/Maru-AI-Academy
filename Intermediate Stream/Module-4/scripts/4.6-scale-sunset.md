# 4.6 Scale-out & sunset (portfolio thinking)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Treat automations like a **portfolio**: add winners, fix maybes, retire losers.

### Scale-Out Checklist

**Quality stability** (low rework) for 2‚Äì4 weeks

- Consistent performance over time
- Low error rates and rework
- Reliable outputs

**Clear ROI** (minutes saved) and owner capacity

- Measurable business value
- Sufficient team capacity to handle volume
- Positive cost-benefit ratio

**Training complete** (policy sign-off + SOP read)

- All users trained and certified
- Clear understanding of procedures
- Regular refresher training scheduled

**Spend within cap**

- Costs under control
- Budget allocation appropriate
- Scaling doesn't break budget

### Sunset Criteria

**Low usage**

- Not being used by target audience
- Low adoption despite training
- Better alternatives available

**High rework**

- Quality issues persist
- More time spent fixing than saving
- Negative ROI

**Better alternative exists**

- New tool or process is superior

### Sunset Process

1. **Archive SOP** and documentation
2. **Disable** the automation
3. **Keep summary note** in registry
4. **Communicate** changes to team
5. **Migrate** data and processes

## Example Portfolio Decision
