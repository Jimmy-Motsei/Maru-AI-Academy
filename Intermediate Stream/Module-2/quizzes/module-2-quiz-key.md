# Intermediate Module 2 Quiz Key

## Section 1: What is semantic search

1. **B** - Semantic search uses embeddings to find passages based on meaning, not just exact keyword matches.

2. **B** - The system should honestly say it doesn't know and ask to add sources rather than hallucinate answers.

3. **C** - Citations with file and page/timestamp are essential for verifiability and trust.

## Section 2: Build your mini-library

4. **B** - Smaller chunks allow the system to retrieve the exact relevant information, improving precision.

5. **B** - Comprehensive metadata including title, owner, version, date, doc_type, and access level enables proper governance and targeting.

6. **B** - Client-owned content should have appropriate licensing restrictions to respect intellectual property rights.

## Section 3: Ask better questions

7. **B** - Prompts must require citations for verification and prohibit invented facts to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness.

8. **B** - When documents conflict, the system should acknowledge the conflict and ask for clarification rather than choosing arbitrarily.

9. **B** - For numerical data, exact figures with source citations ensure accuracy and verifiability.

## Section 4: Access, privacy & POPIA

10. **B** - Row-level security ensures users can only access documents they're authorized to see, maintaining data isolation.

11. **B** - POPIA compliance requires data minimization, avoiding indexing personal data unless necessary and properly consented.

12. **B** - Audit logs should be used to improve content coverage while protecting individual user privacy.

## Section 5: Reduce hallucinations

13. **B** - 3-5 chunks provide a good balance between precision and recall, avoiding information overload.

14. **B** - Low confidence should trigger honest fallback responses and suggestions for adding missing sources.

15. **B** - A small, focused test set with expected citations provides continuous quality monitoring without overwhelming effort.

## Section 6: Hands-on workflow

16. **B** - Clean formatting and proper export format improve chunking and retrieval accuracy.

17. **B** - Clear access rules and citation trust guidelines ensure safe and effective system rollout.

18. **B** - FAQ pages built from actual search patterns provide self-improving documentation and user guidance.
