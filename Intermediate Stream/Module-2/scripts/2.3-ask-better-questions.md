# 2.3 Ask better questions (prompts for precise, cited answers)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Your Q&A prompt should **force citations** and allow the model to **ask for missing info**.

### Template Structure

- **Role:** Act as a company knowledge assistant
- **Goal:** Answer the question **only** from the provided library
- **Inputs:** {user question}
- **Rules:** **Cite sources** (file + page/timestamp) for every claim. If sources disagree or are missing, say so and ask for clarification or more docs. **No invented facts**
- **Format:** Short answer (≤120 words) + bullet list of citations `[Title – page/timestamp]` + "follow-ups" (2 questions to refine)

### Prompt Variants

- **For procedures:** Ask for **step-by-step** outputs
- **For numbers:** Ask to **quote exact figures** and where they came from
- **For policies:** Ask for **specific sections** and **exceptions**

### Example Prompt
