# 2.4 Access, privacy & POPIA (who sees what)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Not everyone should see everything. Set rules up front:

### Access Control Levels

- **Public**: Available to everyone
- **Internal**: Company employees only
- **Confidential**: Specific roles or teams only

### Implementation Strategies

- **Per-team libraries**: Finance, ops, HR have separate knowledge bases
- **RLS (row-level security)**: Users only search within their org/team
- **POPIA compliance**: Avoid indexing **personal data** unless necessary and consented
- **Audit logging**: Track who searched what (aggregate for improvement; protect privacy)

### POPIA Guidelines

- Default to **internal** access
- Promote to **public** only when approved
- Keep **confidential** for named roles
- Mask personal identifiers where possible
- Document data processing purposes

### Practical Implementation

1. Classify documents by sensitivity level
2. Set up access controls before indexing
3. Implement audit logging
4. Regular access reviews
5. Data retention policies

## Key Takeaways

- Implement proper access controls from the start
- Use row-level security for data isolation
- Follow POPIA data minimization principles
- Audit logs help improve content while protecting privacy
- Regular access reviews maintain security
