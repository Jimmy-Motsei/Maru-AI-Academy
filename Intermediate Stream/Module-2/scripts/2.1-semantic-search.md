# 2.1 What is semantic search (and when to use it)?

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Semantic search lets AI find **meaning**, not just matching words. Instead of hunting for exact phrases, it looks for **related ideas**. This is perfect when:

### When to Use Semantic Search

- You have **policies, SOPs, FAQs, transcripts, slide notes**
- You want the AI to answer **only from your documents**, not the open web
- You need answers with **citations** (file + page/timestamp) you can verify

### When NOT to Use

- Brand-new info that isn't in your library yet
- Then first **add the source**, or the system should politely say "I don't know"

### Core Rule

**Grounded answers only** â€” if the source doesn't say it, the assistant shouldn't either.

## How It Works

1. Documents are broken into chunks and converted to embeddings (mathematical representations of meaning)
2. Questions are also converted to embeddings
3. The system finds the most semantically similar chunks
4. AI generates answers based only on those chunks, with citations

## Key Benefits

- Finds relevant information even with different wording
- Provides verifiable citations
- Prevents hallucinations by grounding answers in your documents
- Enables reliable Q&A over private knowledge

## Key Takeaways

- Semantic search finds meaning, not just keywords
- Always require citations for verification
- Ground answers only in your library
- Say "I don't know" when information is missing
