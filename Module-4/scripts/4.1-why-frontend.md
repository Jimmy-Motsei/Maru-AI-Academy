# 4.1 — Pick the right capstone (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Welcome to your capstone! You'll ship **one live workflow** that saves real time every day. Keep it **simple, safe, and visible**.

This is where everything comes together. You've learned how to choose tools, build automations, and track results. Now you'll create something that actually runs in your daily work and proves the value of AI automation."

## How to choose (3 filters) (4 minutes)
"Use these **3 filters** to pick the right capstone project:

**1. Frequent** — happens daily or weekly
- Look for tasks you do regularly: emails, follow-ups, summaries
- Avoid one-off projects or annual processes
- Examples: daily enquiry replies, weekly status updates, monthly reports
- The more frequent, the more value you'll get

**2. Repeatable** — similar inputs each time
- Choose processes with consistent patterns
- Avoid completely unique tasks each time
- Examples: enquiry responses, meeting summaries, data analysis
- This makes it easier to create effective templates

**3. Safe** — uses **green** or anonymized data; has a built-in **human review** step
- Stick to public information or anonymized data
- Always include human approval before sending to customers
- Avoid sensitive personal data, financial information, or legal documents
- Examples: customer enquiries, internal updates, public reports"

## Good examples (3 minutes)
"**Enquiry → reply draft → human approve → send → log**
- Trigger: New enquiry email or form submission
- AI drafts professional reply with clarifying questions
- Human reviews and approves before sending
- Logs enquiry details and time saved

**Meeting notes → action items → weekly reminder**
- Trigger: Meeting ends or notes are shared
- AI extracts action items and assigns owners
- Human reviews and adjusts assignments
- Sends weekly reminder with progress updates

**Report text → decision summary → task table**
- Trigger: Long report or document shared
- AI creates executive summary with key decisions
- Human reviews for accuracy
- Creates task table with next steps

**Avoid for capstone v1:**
- Legal contracts or agreements
- Payroll or financial calculations
- Anything needing sensitive personal data
- Processes with zero tolerance for errors"

## Your action plan (3 minutes)
"**This week**: Pick one process using the 3 filters
**Next week**: Design the workflow using our canvas
**Week 3**: Build and test with dry runs
**Week 4**: Launch and measure impact

**Pro tip**: Start with the process that takes you 15+ minutes and happens 3+ times per week. That's your sweet spot for maximum value.

**Remember**: It's better to automate one process really well than to try to automate everything at once."
