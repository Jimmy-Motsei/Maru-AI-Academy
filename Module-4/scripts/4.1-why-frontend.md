# 4.1 â€” Why Frontend? (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~6 min

## Opening (1 minute)

"Congratulations! You've built a solid API that can score leads. But who's going to use it? Today we're building the user interface that makes your API actually useful to real people."

_[Show the lead qualification API running]_

## The problem with APIs alone (2 minutes)

"APIs are powerful, but they're not user-friendly:

- **Developers** can use Postman or curl, but that's not scalable
- **Business users** need a simple interface to view and manage leads
- **Decision makers** want dashboards, charts, and insights
- **Your API** is just sitting there, waiting to be discovered"

_[Show Postman vs. a beautiful dashboard]_

## What we'll build (2 minutes)

"Today you'll create a React frontend that:

- **Connects** to your lead qualification API from Modules 2-3
- **Displays** leads in a clean, sortable table
- **Shows** real-time scoring and filtering
- **Provides** export and management features
- **Looks** professional enough for real business use"

_[Show mockup of the dashboard]_

## Why React + TypeScript? (1 minute)

"React because:

- **Component-based** - build once, reuse everywhere
- **Ecosystem** - tons of libraries and community support
- **Jobs** - most frontend jobs require React knowledge

TypeScript because:

- **Catch errors** before they reach users
- **Better IDE support** - autocomplete, refactoring
- **Maintainable** - especially important as apps grow"

_[Transition to setup]_

"Let's scaffold our React app and connect it to your API."
