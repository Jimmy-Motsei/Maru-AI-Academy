# 4.5 — Document & handover (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Document so others can use it.

Most people build workflows but never document them. When they leave or get busy, the workflow stops working and no one knows how to fix it. Today we'll learn how to create documentation that makes your workflow sustainable."

## SOP (one page) (6 minutes)
"**Create a one-page Standard Operating Procedure with these sections:**

**Purpose: what this workflow delivers**
- Clear statement of what the workflow does
- Who benefits from it
- What problem it solves
- Example: 'Automatically drafts professional replies to customer enquiries, saving 10 minutes per enquiry'

**When it runs: trigger and frequency**
- What event starts the workflow
- How often it typically runs
- Any conditions or requirements
- Example: 'Runs when new enquiry email arrives, typically 5-10 times per day'

**How to run: steps 1–4 (with screenshots)**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Include screenshots of key steps
- Make it easy for someone new to follow
- Example: 'Step 1: Check email for enquiry, Step 2: Run AI prompt, Step 3: Review draft, Step 4: Send approved reply'

**Human review: what to check before sending**
- Specific checklist for reviewers
- What to look for and what to change
- Common issues and how to fix them
- Example: 'Check tone, verify facts, ensure contact details are included, look for any invented information'

**Data rules: what's allowed, what to anonymize**
- Clear data classification rules
- What information is safe to use
- What must be anonymized or removed
- Example: 'Use green data only, anonymize customer names, never include ID numbers or financial information'

**Troubleshooting: common issues and fixes**
- List of common problems
- How to identify and fix them
- When to escalate or stop the workflow
- Example: 'If AI invents facts, strengthen the prompt rules; if tone is wrong, add tone guidance'

**Owner & backup: who maintains it**
- Who is responsible for the workflow
- Who can help if the owner is unavailable
- How to contact them
- Example: 'Owner: John Smith, Backup: Sarah Jones, Contact: john@company.com'"

## Policy reminder (2 minutes)
"**Copy your safety line into the SOP: 'No invented facts. Ask when unsure. Cite sources where needed. Human review required.'**

**Make this visible and non-negotiable:**
- Include it in every prompt template
- Post it where everyone can see it
- Train your team on these rules
- Review it regularly

**This policy protects you and your organization:**
- Prevents embarrassing mistakes
- Maintains customer trust
- Ensures compliance with regulations
- Creates a culture of safety"

## Documentation best practices (2 minutes)
"**Keep it simple and visual:**
- Use screenshots and diagrams
- Write in plain English
- Avoid technical jargon
- Make it easy to scan

**Test your documentation:**
- Have someone new try to follow it
- See if they can run the workflow
- Ask for feedback on clarity
- Update based on what you learn

**Keep it current:**
- Update when you change the workflow
