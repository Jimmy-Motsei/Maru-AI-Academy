# 4.4 — Measure impact (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Proving value keeps momentum.

Most people build workflows but never measure their impact. Without measurement, you can't prove value, get buy-in from management, or improve the system. Today we'll learn how to measure and track your success."

## Baseline today (3 minutes)
"**Measure these before you launch:**

**Time per task (minutes)**
- How long does it take to do this task manually?
- Time yourself on 5-10 examples
- Calculate the average time
- This is your baseline for comparison

**Volume per day/week**
- How many times does this task happen?
- Count for a week or two
- Calculate daily and weekly averages
- This shows the potential impact

**Error rate (if any)**
- How often do mistakes happen?
- What types of errors occur?
- How much time is spent fixing errors?
- This helps you measure quality improvement"

## After launch (3 minutes)
"**Log minutes saved per run and any corrections you made**

**Track every run:**
- Date and time
- How long it took with AI vs without AI
- Minutes saved per run
- Any corrections or adjustments needed
- Quality of the output (good/needs work/poor)

**Calculate total impact:**
- Minutes saved per day
- Minutes saved per week
- Time saved as percentage of total time
- Cost per minute saved

**Example calculation:**
- Manual time: 15 minutes per task
- AI time: 3 minutes per task
- Time saved: 12 minutes per task
- Volume: 10 tasks per day
- Daily savings: 120 minutes (2 hours)
- Weekly savings: 600 minutes (10 hours)"

## AI scorecard (weekly) (4 minutes)
"**Create a weekly scorecard with these metrics:**

**Volume handled**
- How many tasks did the AI process?
- How many were approved vs rejected?
- What was the success rate?

**Avg response time (before vs after)**
- Before: Average manual processing time
- After: Average AI processing time
- Improvement: Time saved per task

**Minutes saved (sum)**
- Total minutes saved this week
- Average minutes saved per task
- Percentage improvement

**Quality notes (any fixes)**
- What corrections were needed?
- How often did humans need to intervene?
- What patterns do you see in the fixes?

**Next improvement**
- What will you improve next week?
- What new features will you add?
- What problems need solving?"

## Goal for beginners (2 minutes)
"**Achieve consistent savings (e.g., 8–15 minutes per run), not perfection**

**Focus on consistency over perfection:**
- It's better to save 10 minutes consistently than 20 minutes sometimes
- Aim for 80% success rate, not 100%
- Build trust through reliable results
- Improve gradually over time

**Track these key metrics:**
- Time saved per task
- Success rate (approved vs rejected)
- Error rate and types
- Cost per minute saved
- Team satisfaction

**Share your wins:**
- Report weekly savings to your team
- Celebrate milestones and achievements
- Use data to get buy-in for more automation
- Show the ROI to management"

## Pro tips (1 minute)
"**Make measurement easy:**
- Use simple tools like Google Sheets
- Track only essential metrics
- Review weekly, not daily
- Focus on trends, not individual data points

**Use data to improve:**
- Look for patterns in failures
- Identify opportunities for improvement
- Test changes with small experiments
- Measure the impact of improvements"
