# 4.3 — Build & test (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~15 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Now build a **small first version** and test it thoroughly.

Most people rush to launch without proper testing. This leads to embarrassing mistakes, poor quality outputs, and lost trust. Today we'll learn how to test properly before going live."

## Build tips (4 minutes)

"**Keep to 2–3 actions plus human approval**

Don't try to automate everything at once. Start with:

- Action 1: AI generates draft
- Action 2: Human reviews and approves
- Action 3: Send output and log results

**Use your 5-part prompts with tone, word limits, and 'no invented facts'**

Your prompts should include:

- **Role**: Clear identity for the AI
- **Goal**: Specific task to accomplish
- **Inputs**: What information to use
- **Rules**: Safety guidelines and constraints
- **Format**: How to structure the output

**Store prompts as templates so every run is consistent**

- Save your prompts in a document or tool
- Use the same prompts every time
- Update them based on what you learn
- Share them with your team for consistency"

## Test plan (15–20 min) (6 minutes)

"**Dry-run on 3–5 past examples (anonymized)**

- Take real examples from your work
- Remove or anonymize personal information
- Run them through your workflow
- See what the AI produces
- Check if it meets your standards

**Check tone (polite, clear, local context), facts, and format**

- **Tone**: Does it sound professional and appropriate?
- **Facts**: Are the facts accurate and not invented?
- **Format**: Does it follow your requested structure?
- **Context**: Does it make sense for your local situation?

**Edge cases: missing phone/email, unclear request, long messages**

Test these scenarios:

- What happens if contact details are missing?
- What if the request is unclear or confusing?
- What if the message is too long or too short?
- What if the request is inappropriate or spam?
- What if the AI doesn't understand the context?

**Fix prompts or add checks where outputs failed**

- If tone is wrong, add tone guidance
- If facts are invented, strengthen the 'no invented facts' rule
- If format is wrong, be more specific about structure
- If edge cases fail, add safety checks"

## Only then switch to live (3 minutes)

"**Never go live without testing first**

- Test with at least 3-5 examples
- Fix all major issues
- Have a plan for edge cases
- Make sure human review works
- Verify logging captures the right information

**Start small and safe**

- Begin with one team or one inbox
- Monitor closely for the first week
- Be ready to pause if problems arise
- Have a backup plan for manual processing

**Pro tip**: It's better to delay launch by a week than to launch with problems. Your reputation and your team's trust are at stake."

## Common testing mistakes (2 minutes)

"**Mistake 1**: Testing only with perfect examples

- **Solution**: Test with real, messy examples

**Mistake 2**: Skipping edge case testing

- **Solution**: Test what happens when things go wrong

**Mistake 3**: Not testing the human review step

- **Solution**: Make sure humans can actually review and approve

**Mistake 4**: Going live too quickly

- **Solution**: Take time to test thoroughly

**Mistake 5**: Not having a rollback plan

- **Solution**: Know how to stop the workflow if needed"

_[Transition to measurement]_

"Now let's learn how to measure the impact of your workflow and track its success over time."
