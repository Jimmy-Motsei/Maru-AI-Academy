# 2.5 â€” Tracking & follow-through (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Great work needs **follow-through**. Without tracking, the best insights and action items get lost in the shuffle.

Here's how to turn any output into trackable items that actually get done."

## The tracking template (4 minutes)

"Here's your **tracking template**:

**Role:** Act as an operations assistant.

**Goal:** Extract actions and create a weekly checklist.

**Inputs:** {paste email/report/notes}.

**Rules:** Group by owner; include due dates; mark blockers; keep to one screen.

**Format:** Table: **Task | Owner | Due | Status | Notes**. At the end, generate a **weekly reminder message** I can paste into email/WhatsApp.

_[Show the template on screen]_

This works for meeting notes, project updates, client communications, and any document with action items."

## Example in action (3 minutes)

"**Example ask:**
'Extract all action items from this project update meeting and create a tracking table. Include who's responsible, when it's due, and any blockers.'

_[Show meeting notes and the generated tracking table]_

See how it:

- Extracts specific, actionable tasks
- Assigns clear ownership
- Sets realistic due dates
- Identifies potential blockers
- Creates a weekly reminder message"

## No-code tip (2 minutes)

"Feed this table to your simple workflow tool or spreadsheet. You'll have visibility and momentum without new software.

**Integration options:**

- **Google Sheets**: Copy the table directly
- **Trello**: Create cards from each row
- **Asana**: Import as tasks with assignments
- **WhatsApp**: Send the reminder message to your team

**Weekly reminder example:**
'Hi team! Here's this week's action items: Sarah - complete budget review by Friday, Mike - finalize client proposal by Wednesday. Any blockers? Let me know!'

This keeps everyone accountable without being pushy."

## Common tracking scenarios (2 minutes)

"**Project Updates:**

- Focus on milestones and deliverables
- Include dependencies between tasks
- Highlight critical path items

**Client Communications:**

- Track follow-up requirements
- Note response deadlines
- Monitor satisfaction metrics

**Team Meetings:**

- Capture all decisions made
- Assign action items clearly
- Set review dates

**Status Reports:**

- Extract improvement opportunities
- Track progress against goals
- Identify resource needs"

## Pro tips (2 minutes)

"**Save tracking templates** for different scenarios:

- 'Tracking - Project Update'
- 'Tracking - Client Follow-up'
- 'Tracking - Team Meeting'
- 'Tracking - Status Report'

**Time saved**: 20-30 minutes per tracking session.

**Quality improvement**: Nothing falls through the cracks, better team coordination.

**Weekly habit**: Set aside 30 minutes every Friday to review and update your tracking tables. This prevents the 'out of sight, out of mind' problem."

## The power of follow-through (1 minute)

"**Why tracking matters:**

- **Accountability**: Everyone knows what they're responsible for
- **Visibility**: Progress is clear and measurable
- **Momentum**: Regular check-ins keep things moving
- **Learning**: You can see what works and what doesn't

**The result**: Projects actually get completed, clients stay happy, teams stay aligned.

This is how you turn good ideas into great results."

_[Transition to integration]_

"Now let's put it all together - one prompt, many outputs, all consistent and trackable."
