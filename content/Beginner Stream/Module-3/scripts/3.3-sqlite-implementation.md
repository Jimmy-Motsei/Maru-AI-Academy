# 3.3 — Build your first micro-automation (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~15 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Let's build a **simple but powerful** flow you can ship today.

**Use case**: When a new enquiry arrives (form or email), send a polite **draft reply** for approval, then **log** the enquiry.

This saves 10-15 minutes per enquiry and ensures consistent, professional responses."

## The complete recipe (5 minutes)

"**Trigger**: New form submission (or email with subject contains 'Enquiry')

**Action 1 (AI draft)**: Create a **polite reply** using your prompt template. Include 2–3 clarifying questions if details are missing.

**Action 2 (Approval)**: Send the draft to a human approver (you) by email/WhatsApp. Only **send to customer after approval**.

**Action 3 (Log)**: Append a row to a **Google Sheet/Excel** with: Date, Name, Contact, Topic, Status (Replied/Questions Sent).

This creates a complete system that handles enquiries professionally while keeping you in control."

## The prompt snippet (3 minutes)

"Here's the **prompt text** for the draft:

**Role**: 'Act as a polite support agent for {Company}.'

**Goal**: 'Draft a reply confirming we received the enquiry and asking missing details.'

**Rules**: 'No invented facts. POPIA: no personal data beyond what client sent. Keep to 120–160 words.'

**Format**: 'Subject + greeting + body + bullets for questions + sign-off.'

This creates professional, consistent replies that ask the right questions."

## Safety rules (2 minutes)

"**Critical safety rule**: If contact details are missing, **do not send**; ask for them in the approval message.

**Additional safety checks**:

- Never send AI-generated content directly to customers
- Always include human approval step
- Log every attempt, successful or not
- Flag unusual or suspicious enquiries for manual review

**Example safety flow**:

1. AI drafts reply
2. Checks: Does it have contact details? Is it professional?
3. If yes: Send to human for approval
4. If no: Send to human with 'Missing details' flag
5. Human reviews and sends or requests more info"
