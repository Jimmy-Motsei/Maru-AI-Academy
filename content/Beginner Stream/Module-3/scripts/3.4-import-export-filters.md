# 3.4 â€” Tracking & dashboards (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"If you don't **see the wins**, you'll stop using the flow. Let's track them.

Most people build automations but never measure their impact. Without tracking, you can't prove value, spot problems, or improve the system.

Today we'll create simple dashboards that show exactly how much time and money you're saving."

## Log sheet columns (3 minutes)

"**Essential columns for your log sheet**:

**Timestamp** - When the enquiry arrived
**Channel** - email/form/phone/WhatsApp
**Contact** - Name and contact details (anonymized if needed)
**Topic** - What they're asking about
**Time saved (minutes)** - How much time the automation saved
**Outcome** - Replied/Questions Sent/Escalated/Resolved
**Notes** - Any special circumstances or follow-up needed

_[Show example log sheet]_

**Pro tip**: Add a column **'Minutes saved'**. If your draft cuts 8 minutes per reply and you send 10 replies/day, that's **80 minutes saved daily**."

## Weekly view (3 minutes)

"**Create a weekly summary** with these metrics:

**Count enquiries** - How many came in this week?
**Average response time** - How quickly did you reply?
**% needing clarifications** - How often did the AI miss something?
**Total minutes saved** - Your time savings for the week
**Cost per enquiry** - How much did the automation cost?

_[Show example weekly summary]_

**Example calculation**:

- 20 enquiries this week
- 8 minutes saved per enquiry
- 160 minutes total saved (2.7 hours)
- $5 in automation costs
- Net value: 2.7 hours of your time for $5"

## Dashboard options (3 minutes)

"**Start simple**: Use a chart or pivot in your Google Sheet/Excel

**Basic dashboard**:

- Bar chart: Enquiries per day
- Line chart: Response time trend
- Pie chart: Topics breakdown
- Number: Total time saved this month

**Upgrade later**: Use lightweight BI tools like:

- Google Data Studio (free)
- Microsoft Power BI (free tier)
- Tableau Public (free)

**Key metrics to track**:

- Time saved per day/week/month
- Cost per enquiry
- Quality score (how often human approval needed)
- Customer satisfaction (if you survey)"

## Making it visible (2 minutes)

"**Post your wins**:

- Share weekly time-saved numbers with your team
- Celebrate milestones (100 hours saved, 1000 enquiries processed)
- Show cost savings to management
- Use screenshots of your dashboard in presentations

**Set goals**:

- Aim for 1 hour saved per day in month 1
- Target 2 hours saved per day in month 2
- Goal: 80% of enquiries handled automatically by month 3

**Review regularly**:

- Weekly: Check the numbers, spot trends
- Monthly: Analyze what's working, what needs improvement
- Quarterly: Plan next automation project"

## Troubleshooting with data (1 minute)

"**If time saved is low**: Check if the automation is running properly

**If quality is poor**: Review and improve your prompts

**If costs are high**: Switch to cheaper models or reduce frequency

**If team isn't using it**: Show them the time savings and get their input

**Data tells the story**: Use numbers to prove value and drive improvement"
