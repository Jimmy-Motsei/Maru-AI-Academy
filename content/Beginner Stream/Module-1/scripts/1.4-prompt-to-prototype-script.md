# 1.4 — Prompts that work (the 5-part pattern) (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~15 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Great prompts are simple and structured. Use this 5-part pattern:

1. **Role** – who the AI should act as
2. **Goal** – what outcome you want
3. **Inputs** – the raw text or bullet points
4. **Rules** – tone, length, safety notes, POPIA reminders
5. **Format** – the shape of the answer (bullets, table, email draft)

This template works for almost anything—emails, slides, reports, summaries. Let me show you how."

## The 5-part pattern explained (5 minutes)

"**Part 1 - Role**: Who should the AI act as?

- 'Act as a polite customer support rep'
- 'Act as a professional business consultant'
- 'Act as a friendly marketing assistant'

This sets the tone and expertise level.

**Part 2 - Goal**: What exactly do you want?

- 'Draft a reply confirming a booking'
- 'Create a 5-slide presentation outline'
- 'Summarize the key points and action items'

Be specific about the outcome.

**Part 3 - Inputs**: What information are you providing?

- 'Customer: Thabo. Booking ref: 1234. Dates: 3–5 Oct'
- 'Meeting notes from yesterday's team call'
- 'These 5 bullet points about our new product'

Give the AI the raw material to work with.

**Part 4 - Rules**: What are the constraints?

- 'Be concise, friendly, no jargon'
- 'Keep it under 200 words'
- 'Do not invent facts. If info is missing, ask'
- 'Use professional tone but approachable'

This ensures the output meets your standards.

**Part 5 - Format**: How should the answer look?

- 'Return a complete email with subject line + greeting + body + sign-off'
- 'Create a table with columns for topic, key points, and next steps'
- 'Use bullet points with clear headings'

This makes the output ready to use."

## Live example (5 minutes)

"Let's try this with a real example. I need to reply to a customer booking:

**Role**: 'Act as a polite customer support rep.'

**Goal**: 'Draft a reply confirming a booking and asking 3 clarifying questions.'

**Inputs**: 'Customer: Thabo. Booking ref: 1234. Dates: 3–5 Oct. Special request: late check-in.'

**Rules**: 'Be concise, friendly, no jargon. Do not invent facts. If info is missing, ask.'

**Format**: 'Return a complete email with subject line + greeting + body + sign-off.'

_[Show the AI generating the response]_

See how structured this is? The AI knows exactly what to do and how to do it."

## Common variations (2 minutes)

"**For emails**: Always include subject line, greeting, body, sign-off
**For reports**: Use headings, bullet points, clear structure
**For presentations**: Include slide titles, speaker notes, visual suggestions
**For summaries**: Extract key points, action items, next steps
**For creative work**: Specify tone, style, target audience

The format part is crucial—it determines how usable the output is."

## Pro tips (1 minute)

"**Save your best prompts**: Create a prompts folder and reuse successful ones
**Start simple**: Begin with basic prompts, then add complexity
**Test and iterate**: Try different versions to see what works best
**Be specific**: Vague prompts get vague results
**Include examples**: Show the AI what good output looks like"

## Practice exercise (2 minutes)

"Now it's your turn. Pick one of these scenarios and write a 5-part prompt:

1. **Email**: Reply to a client asking about project status
2. **Summary**: Summarize a long meeting into key points
3. **Presentation**: Turn 5 bullet points into a slide outline
4. **Report**: Analyze sales data and suggest improvements

Use the 5-part pattern: Role, Goal, Inputs, Rules, Format.
