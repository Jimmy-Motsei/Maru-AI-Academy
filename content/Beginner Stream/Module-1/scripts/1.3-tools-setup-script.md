# 1.3 â€” Safe use (POPIA basics + common-sense rules) (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (1 minute)

"Safety first. Three plain rules for using AI tools responsibly and legally, especially under POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act)."

## The three data categories (4 minutes)

"**Green data (safe to share)**:

- Public information: news articles, blog posts, general knowledge
- Generic text: templates, examples, anonymized content
- Your own published work: articles, social media posts
- General business information: industry trends, public company data

This is your go-to data for AI tools. When in doubt, use this."

"**Yellow data (be careful)**:

- Internal working notes: meeting minutes, draft documents
- Company information: policies, procedures, internal communications
- Personal work: your own emails, reports, presentations
- **Rule**: Remove names, IDs, and sensitive details before sharing
- **Example**: Instead of 'John Smith at ABC Corp needs help with contract XYZ', use 'A client needs help with a contract'"

"**Red data (do not share)**:

- Personal information: ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses
- Client files: contracts, financial records, personal details
- Health information: medical records, insurance details
- Financial data: bank statements, credit card numbers
- Confidential business: trade secrets, proprietary information
- **Rule**: If you wouldn't email it to a stranger, don't paste it into an AI tool"

## POPIA compliance (3 minutes)

"**POPIA principle**: Share the least data needed for the task, and only with tools you trust.

**Data minimization**: Only share what's absolutely necessary

- Need a summary? Share the document, not personal details
- Need help with an email? Remove names and specific identifiers
- Need analysis? Use anonymized examples

**Consent and purpose**: Make sure you have the right to share the data

- Your own work? Usually fine
- Client data? Get explicit permission
- Company data? Check your policies

**Security**: Use reputable, trusted AI tools

- Stick to well-known platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot
- Avoid unknown or suspicious AI tools
- Check the tool's privacy policy and data handling practices"

## Two essential habits (2 minutes)

"**Habit 1 - Add safety to your prompts**:
Always add this to your prompts: 'Do not invent facts. If unsure, ask for clarification. Cite sources.'

This prevents AI from making up information and keeps you in control.

**Habit 2 - Human review**:
When drafting client content, run a final human check before sending. AI accelerates you; you remain accountable.

- Review all AI-generated content
- Check facts and figures
- Ensure tone matches your brand
- Verify compliance with your policies"

## Common mistakes to avoid (2 minutes)

"**Mistake 1**: Pasting full contracts or sensitive documents

- **Solution**: Extract only the relevant sections, anonymize details

**Mistake 2**: Sharing personal information without thinking

- **Solution**: Always ask 'Would I share this in an email to a stranger?'

**Mistake 3**: Assuming AI outputs are always accurate

- **Solution**: Always verify important information independently

**Mistake 4**: Using AI for tasks it's not designed for

- **Solution**: Stick to text-based tasks, avoid sensitive calculations

**Mistake 5**: Not reviewing AI outputs before using them

- **Solution**: Make human review a mandatory step"

## When in doubt (1 minute)

"When you're unsure about data safety:

1. **Ask yourself**: Would I share this in a public email?
2. **Anonymize**: Remove names, IDs, and specific details
3. **Check policies**: What does your company allow?
4. **Use examples**: Create generic examples instead of real data
5. **Ask permission**: When in doubt, ask your manager or legal team

Remember: It's better to be cautious than to risk a data breach or legal issue."
