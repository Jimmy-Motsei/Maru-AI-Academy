# 2.1 — The reusable prompt frame (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Welcome to Module 2. Our goal is to turn good prompts into **reusable templates** you can use every day.

Recall the 5-part prompt: **Role → Goal → Inputs → Rules → Format**.

Today we'll add two upgrades:

1. **Variables** — placeholders you swap quickly, like `{client_name}`, `{deadline}`, `{tone}`.
2. **Quality checks** — ask the AI to **list assumptions** and **flag missing info** before finishing."

## The base work prompt template (4 minutes)

"Here's the **template you can save**:

**Role:** Act as a helpful {role} for a {industry} business.

**Goal:** Produce {deliverable} that achieves {outcome}.

**Inputs:** {paste raw text, bullets, or transcript}.

**Rules:** Be {tone}. Keep facts grounded in inputs. If info is missing, ask 2–3 clarifying questions. Apply POPIA (no personal data).

**Format:** Return {structure}, plus a short checklist at the end.

Store this as **"Work Prompt – Base"** and copy it whenever you start a task. Templates = **speed + consistency**."

## Variables explained (3 minutes)

"Variables are your secret weapon for speed:

**{role}** - customer support agent, marketing manager, project coordinator
**{industry}** - healthcare, retail, consulting, technology
**{deliverable}** - email reply, presentation outline, summary report
**{outcome}** - resolve the issue, inform the team, drive decisions
**{tone}** - professional, friendly, urgent, diplomatic
**{structure}** - bullet points, table, email format, slide outline

Instead of writing prompts from scratch every time, you just fill in the blanks. This saves 5-10 minutes per task."

## Quality checks (3 minutes)

"Always ask the AI to **list assumptions** and **flag missing info** before finishing.

Add this to your Rules: 'List your key assumptions and flag any missing information before completing the task.'

This catches gaps before you send work. Examples:

**Missing info flags:**

- 'Need clarification on budget range'
- 'Requires specific deadline to prioritize'
- 'Missing contact person for follow-up'

**Assumption flags:**

- 'Assuming this is for internal use only'
- 'Assuming standard 2-week timeline'
- 'Assuming client prefers email communication'

This keeps you in control and prevents embarrassing mistakes."

## How to use it (2 minutes)

"**Step 1**: Copy the base template
**Step 2**: Fill in the variables for your specific task
**Step 3**: Paste your inputs
**Step 4**: Review the assumptions and missing info flags
**Step 5**: Use the output and save successful variations

**Pro tip**: Create a folder called 'Prompt Templates' and save variations like:

- 'Email Reply - Customer Service'
- 'Email Reply - Sales Follow-up'
- 'Presentation - Internal Update'
- 'Presentation - Client Proposal'

The more you use templates, the faster you get. This is how you reach 3-5 hours saved per day."

_[Transition to email templates]_

"Now let's apply this to the most common work task: email replies."
