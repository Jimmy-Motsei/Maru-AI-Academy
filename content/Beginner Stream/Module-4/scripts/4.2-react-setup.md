# 4.2 — Design the workflow (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~15 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"Design before you build. Use this one-page canvas to map out your workflow completely.

Most people jump straight into building without thinking through the design. This leads to messy workflows, safety issues, and poor results. Today we'll use a simple canvas to design everything upfront."

## Workflow Canvas (8 minutes)

"**Copy this canvas and fill it out for your project:**

**Name:** e.g., 'Enquiry Auto-Reply + Log'

- Keep it simple and descriptive
- Make it clear what the workflow does

**Trigger:** what starts it (form/email/meeting end)

- Be specific about the exact event
- Examples: 'Email with subject containing Enquiry', 'Form submission on website', 'Meeting ends in calendar'

**Steps:** list 2–4 actions in order

- Keep it simple: 2-3 actions plus human approval
- Examples: 'AI draft reply → Human review → Send email → Log details'
- Each step should be clear and measurable

**Human review:** where you approve/decline

- Make this explicit and mandatory
- Examples: 'Review AI draft before sending', 'Check action items before assigning', 'Verify summary before sharing'
- Never skip this step for customer-facing content

**Data rules:** green/yellow/red; what to anonymize

- Green: Public information, safe to use
- Yellow: Names and contact details, anonymize when possible
- Red: Never use (ID numbers, financial info, health records)
- Examples: 'Use green data only', 'Anonymize customer names', 'No personal IDs'

**Prompt(s):** paste your final templates

- Include your 5-part prompt structure
- Add tone guidance and word limits
- Include safety rules like 'no invented facts'
- Examples: 'Role: Support agent, Goal: Draft reply, Rules: No invented facts, Format: Subject + body + questions'

**Outputs:** email/summary/task table/notes

- Be specific about what gets created
- Examples: 'Professional email reply', 'Executive summary', 'Task table with owners and due dates'
- Make sure outputs are useful and actionable

**Log fields:** timestamp, owner, outcome, minutes saved

- Track essential information for measurement
- Examples: 'Date, Time, Contact, Topic, Minutes Saved, Outcome, Notes'
- This helps you measure impact and improve

**Tools:** chat assistant, doc helper, sheet; who owns them

- List the specific tools you'll use
- Examples: 'ChatGPT for drafting, Google Sheets for logging, Zapier for automation'
- Make sure you have access and permissions

**Risks & mitigations:** what can go wrong + your check

- Think about potential problems
- Examples: 'Risk: AI invents facts → Mitigation: Human review required', 'Risk: Missing contact info → Mitigation: Ask for details before sending'
- Plan for the worst case scenarios"

## Pro tip (3 minutes)

"**Make the human review step explicit**: 'If missing contact or unclear request → ask for info; do not send.'

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- Skipping the human review step
- Using red data without proper safeguards
- Making the workflow too complex
- Not planning for edge cases
- Forgetting to log results

**Your canvas should answer these questions:**

- What triggers this workflow?
- What steps happen in what order?
- Where does a human check the work?
- What data is safe to use?
- What gets created as output?
- How do we track success?
- What could go wrong and how do we prevent it?"

## Next steps (2 minutes)

"**Complete your canvas** before moving to the next section
**Share it with a colleague** for feedback
**Make sure it's simple** - if it's complex, simplify it
**Focus on safety** - better to be safe than sorry

**Remember**: A good design prevents problems before they happen. Take time to think through every aspect of your workflow."

"Now let's learn how to build and test your workflow with proper dry runs and edge case handling."
