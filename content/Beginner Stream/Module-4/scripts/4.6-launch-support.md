# 4.6 — Launch & support (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~10 min

## Opening (2 minutes)

"It's launch time—keep it calm and reversible.

Most people get excited and launch too broadly too quickly. This leads to problems, mistakes, and lost trust. Today we'll learn how to launch safely and build confidence gradually."

## Launch plan (4 minutes)

"**Start with one team or one inbox for a week**

**Controlled rollout:**

- Choose a small, supportive team
- Use one email inbox or one process
- Keep the scope limited and manageable
- Monitor closely for any issues

**Announce who's on approval duty and expected reply times**

**Clear communication:**

- Tell everyone who will review and approve
- Set clear expectations for response times
- Explain what to do if there are problems
- Provide contact information for questions

**Monitor the log daily; adjust prompts as needed**

**Daily monitoring:**

- Check the log every day for the first week
- Look for patterns in successes and failures
