# 4.4 Policy & risk (simple rules that actually get used)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Policies must be **short and clear** so people follow them.

### One-Page Policy Essentials

**Allowed uses and banned uses (with examples)**

- Clear boundaries for AI tool usage
- Specific examples of what's allowed/not allowed
- Easy to understand and apply

**Data rules:** green/yellow/red classification

- Green: Safe to use (public info, anonymized data)
- Yellow: Use with caution (internal data, anonymize first)
- Red: Never use (personal data, confidential info)
- Default to anonymization

**Approval & human-in-the-loop requirements**

- What content requires human review
- Who can approve different types of content
- Escalation procedures for edge cases

**Citations & grounding rules**

- No invented facts policy
- When and how to cite sources
- How to handle uncertainty

**Retention & deletion policies**

- How long logs and drafts are kept
- When and how data is deleted
- Compliance with POPIA requirements

**Incident response procedures**

- Who to contact for issues
- How to disable automations
- Rollback and recovery steps

### Policy Rollout

1. **Publish** in your LMS or shared location
2. **Add short quiz** for sign-off and understanding
3. **Track acknowledgements** to ensure compliance
4. **Regular reviews** and updates based on feedback
