# 3.6 Governance, privacy & rollbacks

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Make automations **trustworthy** through proper governance and safety measures.

### Documentation Requirements

**SOP per flow:**
- Purpose and business value
- Step-by-step process
- Approval requirements
- Data handling rules
- Owner and responsibilities

### Access Control
- **Least privilege**: Give people only the access they need
- **Role-based permissions**: Editor, approver, viewer roles
- **Audit trail**: Track who made what changes when
- **Regular reviews**: Quarterly access audits

### POPIA Compliance
- **Data minimization**: Only collect what's necessary
- **Consent management**: Clear opt-in/opt-out
- **Retention windows**: Delete data after specified period
- **Redaction in logs**: Remove PII from audit trails

### Rollback Procedures
- **Manual path**: What to do if automation fails
- **Disable switch**: Quick way to turn off automation
- **Escalation process**: Who to contact for issues
- **Recovery steps**: How to restore normal operations

### Change Management
- **Version control**: Track all prompt/component changes
- **Change log**: Record dates, reasons, and impacts
- **Testing**: Validate changes before deployment
- **Rollback plan**: How to revert if issues arise

## Culture Rule
"When in doubt, stop and ask." It's better to pause than send a wrong message.

## Example SOP
```
Lead Handling Automation SOP
Purpose: Automatically triage and respond to new leads
Owner: Sales Operations Manager
Approval: All customer emails require human approval
Data: Store only business contact info, no personal details
Retention: 3 years for successful leads, 1 year for others
Rollback: Disable automation, route to manual queue
```

## Key Takeaways
- Document everything with clear SOPs
- Implement least privilege access control
- Ensure POPIA compliance in all data handling
- Have clear rollback procedures ready
- Foster a culture of safety and accountability
