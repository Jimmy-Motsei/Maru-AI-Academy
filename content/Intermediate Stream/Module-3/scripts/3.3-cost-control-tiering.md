# 3.3 Cost control & model tiering (fast where you can, strong where you must)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Keep automations affordable by **tiering** models and limiting runs.

### Model Tiering Strategy

**Use cheaper/faster models for:**
- Triage and classification
- First drafts and simple tasks
- High-volume, low-stakes operations

**Use higher-quality models for:**
- Final quality checks
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Customer-facing content review

### Cost Control Rules

**Rate Limits:**
- Max runs per hour (e.g., 50 leads/hour)
- Max runs per day (e.g., 500 leads/day)
- Prevent runaway costs

**Monthly Caps:**
- Set spending limits (e.g., $200/month)
- Configure alerts at 80% of cap
- Automatic shutdown at 100%

**Caching & Reuse:**
- Cache common outputs (signatures, boilerplates)
- Reuse templates across similar tasks
- Avoid regenerating identical content

### Prompt Hygiene
- Keep prompts short and focused
- Reuse proven templates
- Avoid dumping huge conversation threads unless necessary
- Use variables instead of hardcoded text

## Example Tiering
```
Triage: GPT-3.5-turbo (fast, cheap)
Draft: GPT-3.5-turbo (good enough for first pass)
Review: GPT-4 (quality check before approval)
Final: Human approval (highest quality)
```

## Key Takeaways
- Tier models based on task complexity and importance
- Set rate limits and monthly caps to control costs
- Cache and reuse common elements
- Keep prompts focused and efficient
