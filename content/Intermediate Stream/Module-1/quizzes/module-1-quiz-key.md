# Intermediate Module 1 Quiz Key

## Section 1: Design prompts as templates

1. **B** - Variables allow quick context swapping without rewriting entire prompts, enabling reusability.

2. **B** - "No invented facts; ask when unsure" is a constraint that governs AI behavior and ensures quality.

3. **C** - Structured outputs like JSON enable automation by allowing other tools to reliably read and process results.

## Section 2: Output contracts

4. **B** - Output contracts define schemas and rules to ensure predictable, reliable AI responses.

5. **C** - Error responses help detect insufficient inputs and prevent bad outputs, implementing fail-fast principles.

6. **A** - Bad examples teach the model what to avoid through contrast learning.

## Section 3: Data readiness

7. **B** - Clean, relevant, well-structured inputs are the primary driver of output quality (garbage in, garbage out).

8. **B** - POPIA compliance requires data minimization, anonymizing personal data where not necessary.

9. **B** - Flagging conflicts and listing assumptions ensures transparency and prevents errors.

## Section 4: Prompt components

10. **B** - Components need purpose, inputs, rules, and format for clear contracts and reusability.

11. **B** - Versioning enables tracking improvements and rolling back if needed for quality control.

12. **B** - Shared, tagged libraries enable team reuse and discoverability.

## Section 5: Template to workflow

13. **B** - Chaining components creates repeatable multi-step workflows that scale beyond single prompts.

14. **B** - JSON format enables machine-readable data that can be fed into tools and dashboards.

15. **B** - Task tables with Owner and Due dates provide clear execution focus and accountability.

## Section 6: Quality gates

16. **B** - Self-check steps ask the model to validate and fix its own output as the first quality gate.

17. **B** - Customer-facing content requires human approval for accountability and quality assurance.

18. **B** - Monthly reviews incorporate feedback and retire weak versions for continuous improvement.
