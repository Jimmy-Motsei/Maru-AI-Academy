# 1.3 Data readiness (clean inputs = clean outputs)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Great outputs start with **clean inputs**. Use this 4-step pre-flight:

### 1) Select: Keep only relevant sections

Remove noise, irrelevant content, and outdated information. Focus on what matters for the task.

### 2) Sanitize: Anonymize names, IDs, exact amounts

Unless necessary for the task, remove personal data, client identifiers, and sensitive financial information (POPIA compliance).

### 3) Structure: Convert into bullets, Q&A, or a simple table

Make the data easy for the AI to process and understand.

### 4) Signal quality: Tell the model what's trustworthy

Add context like "numbers in the table are authoritative" or "this data is from Q3 2024."

## Template Snippet

"**Use only the provided inputs.** If details are missing, ask questions first. If there are conflicting numbers, flag them in `assumptions`."

## Reality Check

Even small cleanup boosts accuracy and reduces hallucinations. The time spent on data preparation pays off in output quality.

## Key Takeaways

- Clean, relevant inputs produce better outputs
- POPIA compliance requires data minimization
- Structure data for easy AI processing
- Signal data quality and trustworthiness
