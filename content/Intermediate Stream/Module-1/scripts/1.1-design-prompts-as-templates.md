# 1.1 Design prompts as templates (variables, constraints, outputs)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Welcome to Intermediate Module 1. Our aim: design prompts that behave like **mini-apps**. A good template has three traits:

### 1) Variables: named placeholders to swap fast

Use `{client}`, `{deadline}`, `{tone}`, `{country}`, `{max_words}`. These let you reuse the same prompt structure across different contexts without rewriting everything.

### 2) Constraints: firm rules

Set word limits, tone requirements, banned phrases, "**no invented facts**," "**ask for missing info**." These ensure consistent behavior and quality.

### 3) Structured outputs: predictable shapes

Design for email blocks, bullet lists, or even **JSON** you can feed into other tools. This makes automation possible.

## Example: Decision Brief Template

**Role:** Act as an operations analyst for a {industry} business in {country}.  
**Goal:** Create a one-page brief that helps {stakeholder} make a decision.  
**Inputs:** {raw notes / transcript / bullets}.  
**Rules:** Plain English; max {max_words} words; **no invented facts**; list **assumptions**; ask **3 clarifying questions** if needed.  
**Format:** JSON with keys: `title`, `summary`, `risks`, `next_steps`, `assumptions`, `questions`.

**Why JSON?** Tools can read it. That means you can chain steps without manual editing.

## Key Takeaways

- Variables make prompts reusable across contexts
- Constraints ensure consistent quality and behavior
- Structured outputs enable automation and tool integration
- JSON format allows for reliable data processing in workflows
