# 1.4 Turning prompts into components (libraries & reuse)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Stop writing from scratch. Build a **prompt library** and treat each prompt like a **component** you can reuse.

### Component Design

- **Name**: "Decision Brief v2", "Email Reply v3"
- **Purpose**: when to use it
- **Inputs**: required variables
- **Rules**: tone, word limits, safety lines
- **Format**: schema or block layout
- **Example**: one good example output
- **Version**: v1, v2, with a change note

### Storage Options

A shared doc, a repo, or your LMS prompt vault. Add tags (email, slides, summary, analysis) for easy discovery.

### Governance

Nominate one **Prompt Owner** per team to review updates monthly. This ensures quality and prevents duplication.

## Example Component Card

```
Name: Client Email Reply v2
Purpose: Professional email responses to client inquiries
Inputs: {client_name}, {inquiry_type}, {response_tone}
Rules: 150-180 words, polite tone, no invented facts
Format: Subject line + greeting + 2-3 paragraphs + sign-off
Example: [Include one good example]
Version: v2 (added POPIA compliance reminders)
```

## Key Takeaways

- Treat prompts as reusable components
- Document purpose, inputs, rules, and format
- Use versioning to track improvements
- Implement governance for quality control
