# 1.6 Quality gates & human-in-the-loop

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Intermediate users add **quality gates**. Three layers:

### 1) Self-check: ask the model to validate schema

Have the model validate its output against the schema and list any uncertainties or missing information.

### 2) Human review: a person approves customer-facing outputs

Never send client communications or important decisions without human approval.

### 3) Feedback loop: track issues and update the prompt component monthly

Continuously improve based on real-world performance and feedback.

## Rubric Outline for Reviewers

- **Fit-for-purpose**: does it answer the ask?
- **Grounding**: facts trace to inputs
- **Tone & length**: meets constraints
- **Safety**: no personal data beyond inputs; POPIA respected

## Policy Reminder

"If in doubt, stop and ask."

## Quality Gate Examples

```
Self-check prompt: "Validate your output against the schema.
If invalid, fix it. List any assumptions or uncertainties."

Human review trigger: "Flag for human review if:
- Contains client-specific information
- Makes financial or legal claims
- Confidence level below 80%"
```

## Key Takeaways

- Implement multiple quality gates
- Always have human review for customer-facing content
- Use feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Document clear review criteria and policies
