# Intermediate Module 1 — From ad-hoc prompts to repeatable workflows

**Project:** Maru AI Academy  
**Version:** 1.0 • **Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Target:** Power users / team leads comfortable with spreadsheets and light configuration

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Module 1, learners can:

- Design prompts as templates with variables, constraints, and structured outputs.
- Create output contracts that make AI responses predictable and reliable.
- Implement data readiness practices for clean inputs and better outputs.
- Build prompt libraries and treat prompts as reusable components.
- Chain components into reliable multi-step workflows.
- Implement quality gates and human-in-the-loop processes.

## Module Structure

- **1.1** Design prompts as templates (variables, constraints, outputs)
- **1.2** Output contracts (how to make AI predictable)
- **1.3** Data readiness (clean inputs = clean outputs)
- **1.4** Turning prompts into components (libraries & reuse)
- **1.5** From template to workflow (email → brief → tasks)
- **1.6** Quality gates & human-in-the-loop

## Assessment

- **Quiz (30%)**: 18 questions across all sections
- **Mini-assignment (70%)**: 3-component workflow challenge

## Prerequisites

- Complete Beginner Stream modules
- Comfortable with spreadsheets and light configuration
- Experience with AI tools and basic prompting
