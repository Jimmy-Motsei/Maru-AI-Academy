# 2.2 Build your mini-library (prep, metadata, versions)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Great Q&A starts with **well-prepared documents**. Use this checklist:

### 1) Collect: Policies, SOPs, templates, product briefs, transcripts

Avoid duplicates. Focus on documents that answer real business questions.

### 2) Clean: Remove outdated sections; fix headings; export to **PDF or clean HTML**

Clean formatting improves chunking and retrieval accuracy.

### 3) Chunk: Break long docs into **small sections** (≈ 2–5 paragraphs)

This allows precise retrieval of relevant information.

### 4) Tag: Add metadata

- `title`: Document name
- `owner`: Who owns this content
- `version`: Version number (v1.2)
- `date`: Last updated
- `doc_type`: SOP, policy, FAQ, transcript
- `access_level`: public/internal/confidential
- `licensing`: original, client-owned, Creative Commons
- `searchable`: Whether it can be searched

### 5) Version: Keep a version label and archive old copies

Track changes and maintain historical versions.

### 6) Licensing: Set proper rights and searchability

Respect intellectual property and access controls.

## Pro Tip

Transcripts are gold. Clean them (speaker names, timestamps) and include them; they answer a lot of real-world "what did we decide?" questions.

## Key Takeaways

- Clean, well-structured documents improve retrieval
- Proper metadata enables governance and targeting
- Chunking improves precision
- Version control maintains document integrity
- Respect licensing and access rights
