# 2.5 Reduce hallucinations (quality checks & evaluation)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Make the system **say less but say it right**.

### Quality Control Strategies

**Top-k retrieval sanity**: Start with 3–5 chunks; increase only if needed

- More chunks don't always mean better answers
- Focus on precision over recall

**Diversity**: Prefer unique sources over many from the same page

- Avoid over-reliance on single documents
- Ensure balanced perspective

**Faithfulness checks**: Ask the model to **quote or paraphrase** and align to citations

- Verify that answers match the source material
- Check for proper attribution

**Low-confidence fallback**: Reply "I don't know from the library" and propose what to add

- Honest uncertainty is better than wrong answers
- Use feedback to improve the library

**Evaluation**: Keep a small test set (10–20 Q&As) with expected citations; review monthly

- Regular testing ensures quality
- Track performance over time

### Safety Line

Include in all Q&A prompts: "**Only answer from the library. If unsure, say so.**"

## Key Takeaways

- Quality over quantity in retrieval
- Prefer diverse sources
- Verify faithfulness to sources
- Implement honest fallbacks
- Regular evaluation maintains quality
