# 2.6 Hands-on workflow (create a mini-library + Q&A)

## Instructor Script (3-5 min)

Let's build your first **private knowledge Q&A**:

### Step 1: Collect 5–10 docs

Gather policies, SOPs, transcripts. Clean headings; export as PDF/HTML.

### Step 2: Add metadata

Include title, owner, version, date, doc_type, access level for each document.

### Step 3: Chunk & index

Break documents into 2–5 paragraph chunks for optimal retrieval.

### Step 4: Create the Q&A prompt

Include strict citations and "no invented facts" requirements.

### Step 5: Test with 10 common questions

Check citations & correctness. Verify answers are grounded in sources.

### Step 6: Publish to the team

Set up access rules and add help note: _"If an answer lacks citations, don't trust it—report it."_

### Iteration Process

- Add missing docs the system asks for
- Build a simple **FAQ top-hits** page from the searches
- Regular evaluation and improvement
