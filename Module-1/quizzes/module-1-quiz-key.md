2) **B. Pricing/limits are based on tokens**  
   *Token usage directly affects API costs and rate limits - more tokens = higher cost.*

3) **B. How much the model can consider at once**  
   *Context window is the maximum number of tokens the model can process in a single request.*

   *Smaller models can be more cost-effective and faster for simple, well-defined tasks.*

7) **True**  
   *Never paste API keys, passwords, or sensitive data into AI tools for security reasons.*

8) **B. VS Code + GitHub**  
   *These are the core development tools covered in this module for code editing and version control.*

9) **B. Reflect + iterate**  
   *The 5-step prompt loop ends with reflection and iteration to improve results.*
