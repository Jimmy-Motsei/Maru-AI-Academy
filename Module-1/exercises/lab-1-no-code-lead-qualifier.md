# Mini-assignment — AI Productivity Practice (5–10 min)

**Time:** 5–10 min

## Objective

Pick one real email or report from your work. Use the 5-part prompt pattern to produce a clean output. Record time saved (minutes). Upload original + AI output (with sensitive data removed).

## Steps

1. **Choose your task**: Pick one of these from your actual work:

   - A messy email thread that needs cleaning up
   - A long report that needs summarizing
   - Bullet points that need to become a presentation outline
   - A document that needs a professional rewrite

2. **Anonymize the data**: Remove names, IDs, and sensitive information before using with AI

3. **Use the 5-part prompt pattern**:

   - **Role**: Who should the AI act as?
   - **Goal**: What exactly do you want?
   - **Inputs**: The anonymized content
   - **Rules**: Tone, length, safety notes
   - **Format**: How should the output look?

4. **Record your results**:

   - Time taken with AI vs. without AI
   - Quality of the output
   - What worked well
   - What could be improved

5. **Submit**:
   - Original content (anonymized)
   - AI-generated output
   - Time saved calculation
   - Brief reflection (2-3 sentences)

## AI Rubric (Behind the Scenes)

- **Clarity (40%)**: Is the output clear and well-structured?
- **Safety (30%)**: Was sensitive data properly protected?
- **Fit-for-purpose (30%)**: Does the output meet the stated goal?
