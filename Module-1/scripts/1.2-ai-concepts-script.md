# 1.2 — AI Concepts You'll Actually Use (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~8–10 min

## Opening (1 minute)
"Let's cut through the hype. These are the 8 concepts you need to know to build with AI. No PhD required - just practical understanding."

*[Show slide with the 8 concepts]*

## Plain‑language definitions (6 minutes)

### **LLM** (1 minute)
"Large Language Model - think of it as a really good pattern predictor. It's been trained on massive amounts of text, and now it can guess what comes next in a sequence. Like autocomplete, but for entire conversations."

*[Show example: "The weather today is" → model predicts "sunny"]*

### **Token** (1 minute)
"A token is a chunk of text - could be a word, part of a word, or punctuation. Why does this matter? Because pricing and limits are based on tokens, not characters. 'Hello' might be 1 token, but 'unbelievable' might be 3 tokens."

*[Show tokenizer demo if possible]*

### **Prompt** (1 minute)
"Your prompt is your specification to the model. It's like giving instructions to a very smart intern. Clear structure = better outputs. Think of it as: 'You are a [role]. Do [task] with [data]. Return [format].'"

### **System vs User prompts** (1 minute)
"Two types of prompts: System prompts set the tone and role - 'You are a helpful assistant.' User prompts give the actual task - 'Write a summary of this meeting.' This separation helps the model understand context better."

### **Context window** (1 minute)
"How much the model can 'remember' at once. Like RAM for AI. If your conversation gets too long, the model starts forgetting the beginning. Most models today can handle 4K-32K tokens - that's roughly 3,000-24,000 words."

### **Embeddings** (1 minute)
"Numeric fingerprints of text. Convert 'I love pizza' into a list of numbers that captures its meaning. Then you can find similar text by comparing these number lists. Great for search and matching."

## The 5‑step prompt loop (2 minutes)
"Here's your secret weapon for getting good results:

1) **Clarify goal & constraints** - What exactly do you want? What are the rules?
2) **Provide structured inputs & examples** - Give it clear data and show it what good output looks like
3) **Ask for a specific output format** - JSON, bullet points, whatever you need
4) **Test with edge cases** - Try weird inputs to see where it breaks
5) **Reflect + iterate** - What worked? What didn't? How can you improve it?"

*[Show the loop visually]*

## Safety & ethics (1 minute)
"Quick safety notes:
- **Data handling**: Never paste API keys, passwords, or sensitive data into AI tools
- **Attribution**: Be honest about where AI helped with your work
- **Bias awareness**: AI can reflect biases in training data - always review outputs"

*[Transition to tools setup]*

"Now let's set up the tools you'll use to put these concepts into practice."
