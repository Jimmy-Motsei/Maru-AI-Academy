# 1.2 — Tool categories you'll use (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~10 min

## Opening (1 minute)

"AI tools come in a few useful buckets for daily work. You don't need them all on day one. In this course we'll focus on a chat assistant, a document helper, and one no-code workflow. The idea is simple: pick the right tool for the job, then make the steps repeatable."

## Chat assistants (2 minutes)

"**General help tools** - these are your Swiss Army knives:

- **Write**: Emails, reports, social media posts, proposals
- **Summarize**: Long documents, meeting notes, research papers
- **Brainstorm**: Ideas, solutions, creative approaches
- **Translate**: Between languages quickly and accurately
- **Outline**: Structure for presentations, documents, projects

Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, Google Bard, Microsoft Copilot

These are perfect for 80% of your daily AI needs. Start here."

## Document helpers (2 minutes)

"**Specialized for long content** - these excel at reading and processing documents:

- **Read long PDFs/Docs**: Extract key points from contracts, reports, research
- **Draft replies**: Respond to complex emails or documents
- **Analyze**: Find patterns, inconsistencies, or important details
- **Format**: Convert between different document types

Examples: Notion AI, Perplexity, PDF.ai, DocuSign AI

Use these when you need to work with specific documents or files."

## Slide & image helpers (2 minutes)

"**Visual content creation** - turn ideas into presentations and graphics:

- **Turn bullet points into slides**: Professional presentations in minutes
- **Create or improve visuals**: Charts, diagrams, infographics
- **Design**: Social media graphics, flyers, presentations
- **Enhance**: Improve existing images or create new ones

Examples: Gamma, Beautiful.ai, Canva AI, DALL-E, Midjourney

Perfect for when you need to present ideas visually."

## Meeting & voice helpers (2 minutes)

"**Audio and meeting support** - handle spoken content:

- **Transcribe meetings**: Convert audio to text automatically
- **Produce action items**: Extract tasks and decisions from meetings
- **Summaries**: Key points and next steps from calls
- **Voice notes**: Convert your spoken ideas to text

Examples: Otter.ai, Rev, Zoom AI, Microsoft Teams AI

Great for capturing and processing spoken information."

## Workflow bots (no-code) (1 minute)

"**Chain multiple steps together** - automate complex processes:

- **When a form/email arrives** → draft a reply → send for approval → log to a sheet/CRM
- **Data processing**: Extract information and route it to the right place
- **Notifications**: Alert the right people at the right time
- **Integration**: Connect different tools and systems

Examples: Zapier, Make.com, Microsoft Power Automate, IFTTT

Use these to create repeatable, automated workflows."

## How to choose (1 minute)

"Here's the simple decision tree:

1. **Need to write or brainstorm?** → Chat assistant
2. **Working with documents?** → Document helper
3. **Creating presentations or visuals?** → Slide & image helper
4. **Processing audio or meetings?** → Meeting & voice helper
5. **Want to automate multiple steps?** → Workflow bot

Start with one tool from each category you use most. Master it, then add more.

The goal is to have the right tool for every type of work you do."
