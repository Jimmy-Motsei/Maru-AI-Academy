# 1.1 — Welcome & Orientation (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~4–5 min

## Hook (30 seconds)
"Look around this room. In the next 60 minutes, you're going to build something that could actually help a small business qualify leads better. You don't need to be a coder to ship useful AI. You need a clear problem, a small scope, and a repeatable workflow."

*[Pause for effect, let this sink in]*

## What learners will do in Module 1 (1 minute)
"Here's what we're going to accomplish today:

- **First 10 minutes**: Learn the small set of AI concepts that actually matter for building - not the theory, but the practical stuff you'll use every day.
- **Next 12 minutes**: Set up the same tools used in real teams - VS Code, GitHub, and AI coding assistants like Copilot or Cursor.
- **Then 15 minutes**: Master a 5-step prompt loop that will let you prototype AI solutions in minutes, not hours.
- **Finally**: Ship a no-code lead-qualifier that many SMEs could use today - and you'll have the code to prove it."

## Why this matters (1.5 minutes)
"This isn't just about AI - it's about how to learn any new technology:

- **Make → Test → Reflect → Iterate**: We'll build something small, test it immediately, learn from what works, and improve it. Short loops beat long lectures every time.
- **Concrete first**: You'll build a thing first, then we'll name the theory you just used. This sticks better than abstract concepts.
- **Transfer**: The same loop you use today will power your code builds in Module 2 and beyond. This is a skill that scales."

## Logistics (1 minute)
"Quick logistics before we dive in:

- **Repository**: Everything lives in `/Module-1/` - lesson plans, exercises, quizzes, and your lab work.
- **Quizzes**: We'll do a quick quiz after concepts - it's 10 questions, you need 7+ to pass.
- **Lab**: The main work is building a lead qualifier in Google Sheets + ChatGPT. You'll submit screenshots and a reflection.
- **Questions**: Ask them! If you're confused, someone else probably is too. We're here to make this work for you."

*[Check for questions, then transition]*

"Ready? Let's start with the AI concepts you'll actually use."
