# 1.1 — What AI is (in plain English) (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~8 min

## Opening (1 minute)

"Welcome! In this lesson we'll keep AI simple.

AI is software that can read, write, summarize, and reason from patterns in data. Think of it like a super-assistant that's good with words, numbers, and examples.

When I say 'model', I mean the brain behind the tool. Different models have different strengths—some are fast and cheap for day-to-day tasks; others are stronger for long documents or complex reasoning.

You use AI by giving it a prompt—that's just your instruction. Good prompts say: what you want, why you want it, the style, and the format you want back.

Your goal in this course is not to become a data scientist. Your goal is to save 3–5 hours a day by turning routine work—emails, slides, reports—into fast, repeatable steps with AI. Let's get you there."

## Model types explained (3 minutes)

"Let's understand the different types of AI models you'll encounter:

**Fast & Cheap Models** (like GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku):

- Perfect for daily tasks: emails, quick summaries, simple writing
- Cost pennies per use
- Great for brainstorming and first drafts
- Use these 80% of the time

**Powerful Models** (like GPT-4, Claude Sonnet):

- Better for complex reasoning, long documents, creative work
- More expensive but higher quality
- Use when you need the best results
- Save these for important tasks

**Specialized Models**:

- Some are great at images (DALL-E, Midjourney)
- Others excel at code (GitHub Copilot)
- Pick the right tool for the job

The key is: start simple, then upgrade when you need more power."

## How AI actually works (2 minutes)

"Here's the simple truth about how AI works:

1. **Training**: The AI reads millions of examples of text, images, or code
2. **Pattern Recognition**: It learns patterns like 'after "Dear" comes a name' or 'emails end with signatures'
3. **Prediction**: When you give it a prompt, it predicts what should come next
4. **Generation**: It creates new content following those patterns

It's like having a super-smart intern who's read everything on the internet and can help you write, summarize, or create based on what it's learned.

The magic is in the prompt—the better your instructions, the better the results."

## Why this matters for your work (2 minutes)

"Here's why this matters for your daily work:

**Time Savings**: What used to take 2 hours now takes 20 minutes
**Consistency**: AI doesn't have bad days or forget details
**Quality**: With good prompts, AI can produce professional-level output
**Scale**: Handle more work without burning out

But remember: AI accelerates you, it doesn't replace you. You're still the one making decisions, reviewing outputs, and being accountable.

The goal is to turn you into a super-productive professional who uses AI as their secret weapon."
