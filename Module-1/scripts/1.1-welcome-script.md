# 1.1 — Welcome & Orientation (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~4–5 min

## Hook
“You don’t need to be a coder to ship useful AI. You need a clear problem, a small scope, and a repeatable workflow.”

## What learners will do in Module 1
- Learn the small set of AI concepts that matter for building.
- Set up practical tools used in real teams (VS Code, GitHub, Copilot/Cursor).
- Use a 5‑step prompt loop to prototype quickly.
- Ship a no‑code lead‑qualifier that many SMEs can use today.

## Why this matters (pedagogy in dev)
- **Make → Test → Reflect → Iterate**: short loops beat long lectures.
- **Concrete first**: build a thing, then name the theory you used.
- **Transfer**: the same loop will power your code builds in Module 2+.

## Logistics
- Repo + folder layout
- Where quizzes/exercises live
- How to ask good questions
