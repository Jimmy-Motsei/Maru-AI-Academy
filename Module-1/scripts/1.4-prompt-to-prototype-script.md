# 1.4 — Prompt‑to‑Prototype: No‑Code Lead Qualifier (Instructor Script)

**Length:** ~12–15 min

## Scenario
A small business gets many WhatsApp/website enquiries. We’ll triage leads into **Hot / Warm / Nurture** using a rubric.

## Steps
1) Make a Google Sheet with columns: `name, company, message, budget, urgency, notes, score, segment`.  
2) Copy the rubric from `/rubrics/lead-qualifier-rubric.md`.  
3) Use ChatGPT with the prompt in `/prompts/chatgpt-prompts.md` to rate each row.  
4) Paste results back into the sheet; spot‑check accuracy.  
5) Iterate rubric + prompt; re‑test on edge cases.

## Debrief
- What signals drove scores?  
- Where did it fail? How would you add structure or code later?  
- What would a V2 look like (AppScript or API)?
